      "clinicalPharmacology": "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\n12.1 Mechanism of Action\nLebrikizumab-lbkz is an IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity and slow off-rate to interleukin (IL)-13 and allows IL-13 to bind to IL-13R1 but inhibits human IL-13 signaling through the IL-4R/IL-13R1 receptor complex. IL-13 is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in Type 2 inflammation, which is an important component in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis. Lebrikizumab-lbkz inhibits IL-13-induced responses including the release of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and IgE. Lebrikizumab-lbkz-bound IL-13 can still bind IL-13R2 allowing subsequent internalization and natural clearance of IL-13.\nLebrikizumab-lbkz is an IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity and slow off-rate to interleukin (IL)-13 and allows IL-13 to bind to IL-13R1 but inhibits human IL-13 signaling through the IL-4R/IL-13R1 receptor complex.
