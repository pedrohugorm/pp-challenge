Administration of galcanezumab-gnlm to rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis or to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation at plasma exposures greater than that expected clinically did not result in adverse effects on development (see Animal Data).\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% - 4% and 15% - 20%, respectively. The estimated rate of major birth defects (2.2% - 2.9%) and miscarriage (17%) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine.\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% - 4% and 15% - 20%, respectively.
