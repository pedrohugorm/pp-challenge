Administration of galcanezumab-gnlm to rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis or to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation at plasma exposures greater than that expected clinically did not result in adverse effects on development (see Animal Data).\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% - 4% and 15% - 20%, respectively. The estimated rate of major birth defects (2.2% - 2.9%) and miscarriage (17%) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine.\nIn the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% - 4% and 15% - 20%, respectively.

      "clinicalPharmacology": "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n12.1 Mechanism of action\n12.1 Mechanism of action\nPirtobrutinib is a small molecule, noncovalent inhibitor of BTK. BTK is a signaling protein of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. In B-cells, BTK signaling results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion. Pirtobrutinib binds to wild type BTK and BTK harboring C481 mutations, leading to inhibition of BTK kinase activity. In nonclinical studies, pirtobrutinib inhibited BTK-mediated B-cell CD69 expression and inhibited malignant B-cell proliferation. Pirtobrutinib showed dose-dependent anti-tumor activities in BTK wild type and BTK C481S mutant mouse xenograft models.\nPirtobrutinib is a small molecule, noncovalent inhibitor of BTK.

IL-13 is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in Type 2 inflammation, which is an important component in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis. Lebrikizumab-lbkz inhibits IL-13-induced responses including the release of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and IgE. Lebrikizumab-lbkz-bound IL-13 can still bind IL-13R2 allowing subsequent internalization and natural clearance of IL-13.\nLebrikizumab-lbkz is an IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity and slow off-rate to interleukin (IL)-13 and allows IL-13 to bind to IL-13R1 but inhibits human IL-13 signaling through the IL-4R/IL-13R1 receptor complex.

Patients had active disease as defined by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) 4 despite non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), corticosteroid, or disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy. At baseline, patients had symptoms of AS for an average of 17 years across both studies. At baseline, approximately 32% of the patients were on a concomitant cDMARD. In AS2, all patients discontinued previous treatment with 1 or 2 TNF inhibitors due to either inadequate response or intolerance.\nThe safety and efficacy of TALTZ were assessed in 567 patients, in 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (AS1 and AS2) in adult patients, age 18 years and older with active ankylosing spondylitis.

It is unknown whether TRULICITY will cause thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as the human relevance of dulaglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined.\nOne case of MTC was reported in a patient treated with TRULICITY in a clinical trial. This patient had pretreatment calcitonin levels approximately 8 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). An additional case of C-cell hyperplasia with elevated calcitonin levels following treatment was reported in the cardiovascular outcomes trial (REWIND). Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide, another GLP-1 receptor agonist, have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and GLP-1 receptor agonist use in humans.\nOne case of MTC was reported in a patient treated with TRULICITY in a clinical trial.

Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of TRULICITY and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness).\nRoutine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with TRULICITY. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to the low test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin values may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values greater than 50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated.

Dulaglutide activates the GLP-1 receptor, a membrane-bound cell-surface receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase in pancreatic beta cells. Dulaglutide increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) in beta cells leading to glucose-dependent insulin release. Dulaglutide also decreases glucagon secretion and slows gastric emptying.\nTRULICITY contains dulaglutide, which is a human GLP-1 receptor agonist with 90% amino acid sequence homology to endogenous human GLP-1 (7-37).

Reduced fetal weights associated with decreased maternal food intake and decreased weight gain attributed to the pharmacology of dulaglutide were observed at 1.63mg/kg. Irregular skeletal ossifications and increases in post-implantation loss also were observed at 4.89mg/kg.\nPregnant rats given subcutaneous doses of 0.49, 1.63, or 4.89mg/kg dulaglutide every 3 days during organogenesis had systemic exposures 2-, 6-, and 18-times human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 4.5mg/week, respectively, based on plasma area under the time-concentration curve (AUC) comparison. Reduced fetal weights associated with decreased maternal food intake and decreased weight gain attributed to the pharmacology of dulaglutide were observed at 1.63mg/kg.

Fetal visceral malformation of lung lobular agenesis and skeletal malformations of the vertebrae and/or ribs were observed in conjunction with decreased maternal food intake and decreased weight gain attributed to the pharmacology of dulaglutide at 0.41mg/kg.\nIn pregnant rabbits given subcutaneous doses of 0.04, 0.12, or 0.41mg/kg dulaglutide every 3 days during organogenesis, systemic exposures in pregnant rabbits were 0.5-, 2-, and 5-times human exposure at the MRHD, based on plasma AUC comparison. Fetal visceral malformation of lung lobular agenesis and skeletal malformations of the vertebrae and/or ribs were observed in conjunction with decreased maternal food intake and decreased weight gain attributed to the pharmacology of dulaglutide at 0.41mg/kg.\nIn a prenatal-postnatal study in F0 maternal rats given subcutaneous doses of 0.2, 0.49, or 1.63mg/kg every third day from implantation through lactation, systemic exposures in pregnant rats were 1-, 2-, and 7-times human exposure at the MRHD, based on plasma AUC comparison. F1 pups from F0 maternal rats given 1.63mg/kg dulaglutide had statistically significantly lower mean body weight from birth through postnatal day 63 for males and postnatal day 84 for females. F1 offspring from F0 maternal rats receiving 1.63mg/kg dulaglutide had decreased forelimb and hindlimb grip strength and males had delayed balano-preputial separation. Females had decreased startle response. These physical findings may relate to the decreased size of the offspring relative to controls as they appeared at early postnatal assessments but were not observed at a later assessment. F1 female offspring of the F0 maternal rats given 1.63mg/kg of dulaglutide had a longer mean escape time and a higher mean number of errors relative to concurrent control during 1 of 2 trials in the memory evaluation portion of the Biel water maze. These findings occurred in conjunction with decreased F0 maternal food intake and decreased weight gain attributed to the pharmacologic activity at 1.63mg/kg.

These physical findings may relate to the decreased size of the offspring relative to controls as they appeared at early postnatal assessments but were not observed at a later assessment. F1 female offspring of the F0 maternal rats given 1.63mg/kg of dulaglutide had a longer mean escape time and a higher mean number of errors relative to concurrent control during 1 of 2 trials in the memory evaluation portion of the Biel water maze. These findings occurred in conjunction with decreased F0 maternal food intake and decreased weight gain attributed to the pharmacologic activity at 1.63mg/kg. The human relevance of these memory deficits in the F1 female rats is not known.\n8.2 Lactation\n8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\nRisk Summary\nThere are no data on the presence of dulaglutide in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production.

      "description": "Dulaglutide is a human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. The molecule is a fusion protein that consists of two identical, disulfide-linked chains, each containing an N-terminal GLP-1 analog sequence covalently linked to the Fc portion of a modified human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) heavy chain by a small peptide linker and is produced using mammalian cell (Chinese hamster ovary) culture. The GLP-1 analog portion of dulaglutide is 90% homologous to native human GLP-1 (7-37). Structural modifications were introduced in the GLP-1 part of the molecule responsible for interaction with the enzyme dipeptidyl-peptidase-IV (DPP-4). Additional modifications were made in an area with a potential T-cell epitope and in the areas of the IgG4 Fc part of the molecule responsible for binding the high-affinity Fc receptors and half-antibody formation. The overall molecular weight of dulaglutide is approximately 63 kilodaltons.\nDulaglutide is a human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist.

In animal reproduction studies, administration of abemaciclib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused teratogenicity and decreased fetal weight at maternal exposures that were similar to the human clinical exposure based on area under the curve (AUC) at the maximum recommended human dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with VERZENIO and for 3 weeks after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)].\nBased on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action, VERZENIO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.

These kinases are activated upon binding to D-cyclins. In estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer cell lines, cyclin D1 and CDK4/6 promote phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation.
