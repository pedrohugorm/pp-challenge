This was followed by a 6- to 8-week glycemic stabilization period prior to randomization.\nPatients randomized to insulin glargine were started on a dose of 10units once daily. Insulin glargine dose adjustments occurred twice weekly for the first 4 weeks of treatment based on self-measured fasting plasma glucose (FPG), followed by once weekly titration through Week 8 of treatment, utilizing an algorithm that targeted a fasting plasma glucose of <100mg/dL.

F1 pups from F0 maternal rats given 1.63mg/kg dulaglutide had statistically significantly lower mean body weight from birth through postnatal day 63 for males and postnatal day 84 for females. F1 offspring from F0 maternal rats receiving 1.63mg/kg dulaglutide had decreased forelimb and hindlimb grip strength and males had delayed balano-preputial separation. Females had decreased startle response. These physical findings may relate to the decreased size of the offspring relative to controls as they appeared at early postnatal assessments but were not observed at a later assessment. F1 female offspring of the F0 maternal rats given 1.63mg/kg of dulaglutide had a longer mean escape time and a higher mean number of errors relative to concurrent control during 1 of 2 trials in the memory evaluation portion of the Biel water maze.

      "description": "Dulaglutide is a human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. The molecule is a fusion protein that consists of two identical, disulfide-linked chains, each containing an N-terminal GLP-1 analog sequence covalently linked to the Fc portion of a modified human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) heavy chain by a small peptide linker. It is produced using mammalian cell (Chinese hamster ovary) culture. The GLP-1 analog portion of dulaglutide is 90% homologous to native human GLP-1 (7-37). Structural modifications were introduced in the GLP-1 part of the molecule responsible for interaction with the enzyme dipeptidyl-peptidase-IV (DPP-4). Additional modifications were made in an area with a potential T-cell epitope and in the areas of the IgG4 Fc part of the molecule responsible for binding the high-affinity Fc receptors and half-antibody formation. The overall molecular weight of dulaglutide is approximately 63 kilodaltons.\nDulaglutide is a human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist.
