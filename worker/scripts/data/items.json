      "dosageAndAdministration": "\n<h3>2.1 Recommended Dosing for Migraine</h3>\n<p>The recommended dosage of EMGALITY is 240 mg, which consists of two consecutive subcutaneous injections of 120 mg each, administered once as a loading dose. This is followed by monthly doses of 120 mg injected subcutaneously.</p>\n<p>If a dose of EMGALITY is missed, it should be administered as soon as possible. Thereafter, EMGALITY can be scheduled monthly from the date of the last dose.</p>\n<h3>2.2 Recommended Dosing for Episodic Cluster Headache</h3>\n<p>The recommended dosage of EMGALITY is 300 mg, which consists of three consecutive subcutaneous injections of 100 mg each, administered at the onset of the cluster period. This is followed by monthly doses until the end of the cluster period.</p>\n<p>If a dose of EMGALITY is missed during a cluster period, it should be administered as soon as possible. Thereafter, EMGALITY can be scheduled monthly from the date of the last dose until the end of the cluster period.</p>\n<h3>2.3 Important Administration Instructions</h3>\n<p>EMGALITY is for subcutaneous use only.</p>\n<p>EMGALITY is intended for patient self-administration. Prior to use, provide proper training to patients and/or caregivers on how to prepare and administer EMGALITY using the single-dose prefilled pen or single-dose prefilled syringe, including aseptic technique:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Protect EMGALITY from direct sunlight.</li>\n<li>Prior to subcutaneous administration, allow EMGALITY to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Do not warm by using a heat source such as hot water or a microwave.</li>\n<li>Do not shake the product.</li>\n<li>Inspect EMGALITY visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use EMGALITY if it is cloudy or there are visible particles.</li>\n<li>Administer EMGALITY in the abdomen, thigh, back of the upper arm, or buttocks subcutaneously. Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard.</li>\n<li>Both the prefilled pen and prefilled syringe are single-dose and deliver the entire contents.</li>\n</ul>",

Of these, 1920 patients were exposed to EMGALITY once monthly for at least 6 months, and 526 patients were exposed for 12 months.</p>\n<p>In placebo-controlled clinical studies (Studies 1, 2, and 3), 705 patients received at least one dose of EMGALITY 120mg once monthly, and 1451 patients received placebo, during 3 months or 6 months of double-blind treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Of the EMGALITY-treated patients, approximately 85% were female, 77% were white, and the mean age was 41 years at study entry.</p>\n<p>The most common adverse reaction was injection site reactions. In Studies 1, 2, and 3, 1.8% of patients discontinued double-blind treatment because of adverse events.

A total of 106 patients were studied (49 on EMGALITY and 57 on placebo). Of the EMGALITY-treated patients, approximately 84% were male, 88% were white, and the mean age was 47 years at study entry. Two EMGALITY-treated patients discontinued double-blind treatment because of adverse events.</p>\n<p>Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with episodic cluster headache treated with EMGALITY 300 mg monthly is consistent with the safety profile in migraine patients.</p>\n<h3>6.2 Immunogenicity</h3>\n<p>As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to galcanezumab-gnlm in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.</p>\n<p>The immunogenicity of EMGALITY has been evaluated using an in vitro immunoassay for the detection of binding anti-galcanezumab-gnlm antibodies. For patients whose sera tested positive in the screening immunoassay, an in vitro ligand-binding immunoassay was performed to detect neutralizing antibodies.</p>\n<p>In controlled studies with EMGALITY up to 6 months (Study 1, Study 2, and Study 3), the incidence of anti-galcanezumab-gnlm antibody development was 4.8% (33/688) in patients receiving EMGALITY once monthly (32 out of 33 of whom had in vitro neutralizing activity). With 12 months of treatment in an open-label study, up to 12.5% (16/128) of EMGALITY-treated patients developed anti-galcanezumab-gnlm antibodies, most of whom tested positive for neutralizing antibodies.</p>\n<p>Although anti-galcanezumab-gnlm antibody development was not found to affect the pharmacokinetics, safety or efficacy of EMGALITY in these patients, the available data are too limited to make definitive conclusions.</p>\n<h3>6.3 Postmarketing Experience</h3>\n<p>The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of EMGALITY. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to EMGALITY exposure.</p>\n<p>Immune System Disorders: Anaphylaxis, angioedema [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</p>\n<p>Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Rash.</p>",

      "warningsAndPrecautions": "\n<h3>5.1 Serious Infections</h3>\n<p>Serious and sometimes fatal infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, or other opportunistic pathogens have been reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving OLUMIANT. The most common serious infections reported with OLUMIANT included pneumonia, herpes zoster, and urinary tract infection [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, multidermatomal herpes zoster, esophageal candidiasis, pneumocystosis, acute histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, cytomegalovirus, and BK virus were reported with OLUMIANT. Some patients have presented with disseminated rather than localized disease, and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.</p>\n<p>Avoid use of OLUMIANT in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating OLUMIANT in patients:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>with chronic or recurrent infection</li>\n<li>who have been exposed to tuberculosis</li>\n<li>with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection</li>\n<li>who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or</li>\n<li>with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In patients with rheumatoid arthritis or alopecia areata, closely monitor for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with OLUMIANT. Interrupt OLUMIANT in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or alopecia areata, if the patient develops a serious infection, an opportunistic infection, or sepsis. A patient who develops a new infection during treatment with OLUMIANT should undergo prompt and complete diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised patient; appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated, the patient should be closely monitored, and OLUMIANT should be interrupted if the patient is not responding to therapy. Do not resume OLUMIANT until the infection is controlled.</p>\n<p>In patients with COVID-19, monitor for signs and symptoms of new infections during and after treatment with OLUMIANT. There is limited information regarding the use of OLUMIANT in patients with COVID-19 and concomitant active serious infections. The risks and benefits of treatment with OLUMIANT in COVID-19 patients with other concurrent infections should be considered.</p>\n<p>Tuberculosis</p>\n<p>Evaluate patients for active infection prior to administration of OLUMIANT. OLUMIANT should not be given to patients with active TB.</p>\n<p>Test patients with rheumatoid arthritis or alopecia areata for latent tuberculosis. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis or alopecia areata and latent tuberculosis (TB) should be treated with standard antimycobacterial therapy before initiating OLUMIANT. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiation of OLUMIANT in patients with a history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent TB but who have risk factors for TB infection. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of TB is recommended to aid in the decision about whether initiating anti-TB therapy is appropriate for an individual patient.</p>\n<p>During OLUMIANT use, monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of TB, including patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.</p>\n<p>Viral Reactivation</p>\n<p>Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), were reported in clinical studies with OLUMIANT. If a patient develops herpes zoster, interrupt OLUMIANT treatment until the episode resolves.</p>\n<p>The impact of OLUMIANT on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Patients with evidence of active hepatitis B or C infection were excluded from clinical trials. In clinical trials in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or alopecia areata, patients who were positive for hepatitis C antibody but negative for hepatitis C virus RNA were permitted to enroll. Patients with positive hepatitis B surface antibody and hepatitis B core antibody, without hepatitis B surface antigen, were permitted to enroll; such patients should be monitored for expression of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA. Should HBV DNA be detected, consult with a hepatologist. Perform screening for viral hepatitis in accordance with clinical guidelines before starting therapy with OLUMIANT.</p>\n<h3>5.2 Mortality</h3>\n<p>In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study of another JAK inhibitor in RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, a higher rate of all-cause mortality, including sudden cardiovascular death, was observed in patients treated with the JAK inhibitor compared with TNF blockers. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with OLUMIANT.</p>\n<h3>5.3 Malignancy and Lymphoproliferative Disorders</h3>\n<p>Malignancies were observed in clinical studies of OLUMIANT [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</p>\n<p>In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study of another JAK inhibitor in RA patients, a higher rate of malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC)) was observed in patients treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. A higher rate of lymphomas was observed in patients treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. A higher rate of lung cancers was observed in current or past smokers treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. In this study, current or past smokers had an additional increased risk of overall malignancies.</p>\n<p>Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with OLUMIANT, particularly in patients with a known malignancy (other than successfully treated NMSC), patients who develop a malignancy, and patients who are current or past smokers.</p>\n<p>Non-melanoma skin cancers</p>\n<p>Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) have been reported in patients treated with OLUMIANT. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.</p>\n<h3>5.4 Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events</h3>\n<p>In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study of another JAK inhibitor in RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, a higher rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and non-fatal stroke was observed with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk.</p>\n<p>Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with OLUMIANT, particularly in patients who are current or past smokers and patients with other cardiovascular risk factors. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious cardiovascular events and the steps to take if they occur. Discontinue OLUMIANT in patients that have experienced a myocardial infarction or stroke.</p>\n<h3>5.5 Thrombosis</h3>\n<p>Thrombosis, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), has been observed at an increased incidence in patients treated with OLUMIANT compared to placebo. In addition, arterial thrombosis events in the extremities have been reported in clinical studies with OLUMIANT. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. There was no clear relationship between platelet count elevations and thrombotic events. In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study of another JAK inhibitor in RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, higher rates of overall thrombosis, DVT, and PE were observed compared to those treated with TNF blockers.</p>\n<p>If clinical features of DVT/PE or arterial thrombosis occur, patients should discontinue OLUMIANT and be evaluated promptly and treated appropriately. Avoid OLUMIANT in patients that may be at increased risk of thrombosis.</p>\n<h3>5.6 Hypersensitivity</h3>\n<p>Reactions such as angioedema, urticaria, and rash that may reflect drug hypersensitivity have been observed in patients receiving OLUMIANT, including serious reactions. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, promptly discontinue OLUMIANT while evaluating the potential causes of the reaction [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</p>\n<h3>5.7 Gastrointestinal Perforations</h3>\n<p>Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in clinical studies with OLUMIANT.</p>\n<p>Monitor OLUMIANT-treated patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis). Evaluate promptly patients presenting with new onset abdominal symptoms for early identification of gastrointestinal perforation.</p>\n<h3>5.8 Laboratory Abnormalities</h3>\n<p>Neutropenia Treatment with OLUMIANT was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (ANC less than 1000cells/mm3) compared to placebo.</p>\n<p>In patients with rheumatoid arthritis or alopecia areata, avoid initiation or interrupt OLUMIANT treatment in patients with an ANC less than 1000cells/mm3.</p>\n<p>In patients with COVID-19, there is limited information regarding use of OLUMIANT in patients with ANC less than 1000cells/mm3. Avoid initiation or interrupt OLUMIANT treatment in patients with COVID-19 and an ANC less than 500cells/mm3.</p>\n<p>Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Adjust dosing based on ANC [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.5) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</p>\n<p>Lymphopenia ALC less than 500cells/mm3 were reported in OLUMIANT clinical trials. Lymphocyte counts less than the lower limit of normal were associated with infection in patients treated with OLUMIANT, but not placebo.</p>\n<p>In patients with rheumatoid arthritis or alopecia areata, avoid initiation or interrupt OLUMIANT treatment in patients with an ALC less than 500cells/mm3.</p>\n<p>In patients with COVID-19, there is limited information regarding use of OLUMIANT in patients with ALC less than 200cells/mm3. Avoid initiation or interrupt OLUMIANT treatment in patients with COVID-19 and an ALC less than 200cells/mm3.</p>\n<p>Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Adjust dosing based on ALC [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.5)].</p>\n<p>Anemia Decreases in hemoglobin levels to less than 8g/dL were reported in OLUMIANT clinical trials. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis or alopecia areata, avoid initiation or interrupt OLUMIANT treatment in patients with hemoglobin less than 8g/dL. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Adjust dosing based on hemoglobin levels [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.5)].</p>\n<p>In patients with COVID-19, there is limited information regarding use of OLUMIANT in patients with hemoglobin less than 8g/dL.</p>\n<p>Liver Enzyme Elevations Treatment with OLUMIANT was associated with increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Increases of ALT 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and increases of AST 10 times the ULN were observed in patients in OLUMIANT clinical trials. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Prompt investigation of the cause of liver enzyme elevation is recommended to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. If increases in ALT or AST are observed and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, interrupt OLUMIANT until this diagnosis is excluded [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</p>\n<p>Lipid Elevations Treatment with OLUMIANT was associated with increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Assessment of lipid parameters should be performed approximately 12weeks following OLUMIANT initiation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or alopecia areata [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Manage patients according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia.</p>\n<h3>5.9 Vaccinations</h3>\n<p>Avoid use of live vaccines with OLUMIANT. Update immunizations in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or alopecia areata prior to initiating OLUMIANT therapy in agreement with current immunization guidelines.</p>",

      "drugInteractions": "<h1>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS</h1><h2>7.1 Strong OAT3 Inhibitors</h2><p>Baricitinib exposure is increased when OLUMIANT is co-administered with strong OAT3 inhibitors (such as probenecid), hence the dosage of baricitinib should be reduced by half the recommended dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</p><h2>7.2 Other JAK Inhibitors or Biologic DMARDs</h2><p>OLUMIANT has not been studied in combination with other JAK inhibitors or with biologic DMARDs [see Indications and Usage (1.1, 1.2)].</p>",
      "clinicalPharmacology": "<h1>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1><h2>12.1 Mechanism of Action</h2><p>Baricitinib is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. JAKs are intracellular enzymes which transmit signals arising from cytokine or growth factor-receptor interactions on the cellular membrane to influence cellular processes of hematopoiesis and immune cell function. Within the signaling pathway, JAKs phosphorylate and activate Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs) which modulate intracellular activity including gene expression. Baricitinib modulates the signaling pathway at the point of JAKs, preventing the phosphorylation and activation of STATs.</p><p>JAK enzymes transmit cytokine signaling through their pairing (e.g., JAK1/JAK2, JAK1/JAK3, JAK1/TYK2, JAK2/JAK2, JAK2/TYK2). In cell-free isolated enzyme assays, baricitinib had greater inhibitory potency at JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 relative to JAK3. In human leukocytes, baricitinib inhibited cytokine induced STAT phosphorylation mediated by JAK1/JAK2, JAK1/JAK3, JAK1/TYK2, or JAK2/TYK2 with comparable potencies. However, the relevance of inhibition of specific JAK enzymes to therapeutic effectiveness is not currently known.</p><h2>12.2 Pharmacodynamics</h2><p>Baricitinib inhibition of IL-6 induced STAT3 phosphorylation Baricitinib administration resulted in a dose dependent inhibition of IL-6 induced STAT3 phosphorylation in whole blood from healthy subjects with maximal inhibition observed approximately 1hour after dosing, which returned to near baseline by 24hours. Similar levels of inhibition were observed using either IL-6 or TPO as the stimulus.</p><p>Immunoglobulins Mean serum IgG, IgM, and IgA values decreased by 12weeks after starting treatment with OLUMIANT, and remained stable through at least 52weeks. For most patients, changes in immunoglobulins occurred within the normal reference range.</p><p>C-reactive protein In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, decreases in serum C-reactive protein (CRP) were observed as early as one week after starting treatment with OLUMIANT and were maintained throughout dosing.</p><p>Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 10 times the maximum recommended dose, baricitinib does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent.</p><h2>12.3 Pharmacokinetics</h2><p>Following oral administration of OLUMIANT, peak plasma concentrations are reached approximately at 1hour. A dose-proportional increase in systemic exposure was observed in the therapeutic dose range. The pharmacokinetics of baricitinib do not change over time. Steady-state concentrations are achieved in 2 to 3days with minimal accumulation after once-daily administration.</p><p>Absorption The absolute bioavailability of baricitinib is approximately 80%. An assessment of food effects in healthy subjects showed that a high-fat meal decreased the mean AUC and Cmax of baricitinib by approximately 11% and 18%, respectively, and delayed the tmax by 0.5hours. Administration with meals is not associated with a clinically relevant effect on exposure. In clinical studies, OLUMIANT was administered without regard to meals.</p><p>Distribution After intravenous administration, the volume of distribution is 76L, indicating distribution of baricitinib into tissues. Baricitinib is approximately 50% bound to plasma proteins and 45% bound to serum proteins. Baricitinib is a substrate of the Pgp, BCRP, OAT3 and MATE2-K transporters, which play roles in drug distribution.</p><p>Elimination</p><p>Rheumatoid Arthritis and Alopecia Areata: The total body clearance of baricitinib is 8.9L/h in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 11L/h in patients with alopecia areata. Elimination half-life in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and alopecia areata is approximately 12to 16 hours.</p><p>COVID-19: The total body clearance and half-life of baricitinib is 14.2L/h and 10.8 hours, respectively, in patients with COVID-19 who are intubated and have baricitinib administered via NG or OG tube.</p><p>Metabolism Approximately 6% of the orally administered baricitinib dose is identified as metabolites (three from urine and one from feces), with CYP3A4 identified as the main metabolizing enzyme. No metabolites of baricitinib were quantifiable in plasma.</p><p>Excretion Renal elimination is the principal clearance mechanism for baricitinib through filtration and active secretion as baricitinib is identified as a substrate of OAT3, Pgp, BCRP and MATE2-K from in vitro studies. In a clinical pharmacology study, approximately 75% of the administered dose was eliminated in the urine, while about 20% of the dose was eliminated in the feces. Baricitinib was excreted predominately as unchanged drug in urine (69%) and feces (15%).</p><p>Specific Populations</p><p>Effects of Body Weight, Gender, Race, and Age</p><p>Body weight, gender, race, ethnicity, and age did not have a clinically relevant effect on the PK (AUC and Cmax) of baricitinib (Figure 1). The mean effects of intrinsic factors on PK parameters (AUC and Cmax) were generally within the inter-subject PK variability of baricitinib. The inter-subject variabilities (% coefficients of variation) in AUC and Cmax of baricitinib are approximately 41% and 22%, respectively, in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].</p><p>Patients with Renal Impairment</p><p>Baricitinib systemic exposure in AUC was increased by 1.41-, 2.22-, 4.05- and 2.41-fold for mild, moderate, severe, and ESRD (with hemodialysis) renal impairment sub-groups, respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. The corresponding values for increase in Cmax were 1.16-, 1.46-, 1.40- and 0.88-fold, respectively (Figure 1) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].</p><p>Patients with Hepatic Impairment</p><p>Baricitinib systemic exposure and Cmax increased by 1.19- and 1.08-fold for the moderate hepatic impairment group, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function (Figure 1) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].</p><p>Figure 1: Impact of Intrinsic Factors on Baricitinib Pharmacokineticsa, b</p><p>a Reference values for weight, age, gender, and race comparisons are 70kg, 54years, male, and white, respectively; reference groups for renal and hepatic impairment are subjects with normal renal and hepatic function, respectively.</p><p>b Effects of renal and hepatic impairment on baricitinib exposure were summarized from dedicated renal and hepatic impairment studies, respectively.

OLUMIANT is not recommended for use in patients with COVID-19 who are on dialysis, have end-stage renal disease (ESRD), or acute kidney injury (eGFR &lt;15mL/min/1.73m2). [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]</p><p>Drug Interactions</p><p>Potential for Baricitinib to Influence the PK of Other Drugs</p><p>In vitro, baricitinib did not significantly inhibit or induce the activity of cytochrome P450enzymes (CYPs 3A, 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6). In clinical pharmacology studies, there were no clinically meaningful changes in the pharmacokinetics (PK) of simvastatin, ethinyl estradiol, or levonorgestrel (CYP3A substrates) when co-administered with baricitinib.</p><p>In vitro studies suggest that baricitinib is not an inhibitor of the transporters, P-glycoprotein (Pgp) or Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide (OATP) 1B1. In vitro data indicate baricitinib does inhibit organic anionic transporter (OAT) 1, OAT2, OAT3, organic cationic transporter (OCT) 1, OCT2, OATP1B3, Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) and Multidrug and Toxic Extrusion Protein (MATE) 1 and MATE2-K, but clinically meaningful changes in the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are substrates for these transporters are unlikely. In clinical pharmacology studies there were no clinically meaningful effects on the PK of digoxin (Pgp substrate) or methotrexate (substrate of several transporters) when co-administered with baricitinib.</p><p>Exposure changes of drugs following co-administration with baricitinib are shown in Figure 2.</p><p>Figure 2: Impact of Baricitinib on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugsa</p><p>a Reference group is administration of concomitant drug alone.</p><p>Potential for Other Drugs to Influence the PK of Baricitinib</p><p>In vitro studies suggest that baricitinib is a CYP3A4 substrate. In clinical pharmacology studies there was no effect on the PK of baricitinib when co-administered with ketoconazole (CYP3A inhibitor). There were no clinically meaningful changes in the PK of baricitinib when co-administered with fluconazole (CYP3A/CYP2C19/CYP2C9 inhibitor) or rifampicin (CYP3A inducer).</p><p>In vitro studies suggest that baricitinib is a substrate for OAT3, Pgp, BCRP and MATE2-K. In a clinical study, probenecid administration (strong OAT3 inhibitor) resulted in an approximately 2-fold increase in baricitinib AUC0- with no effect on Cmax and tmax[see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]. However, simulations with diclofenac and ibuprofen (OAT3 inhibitors with less inhibition potential) predicted minimal effect on the PK of baricitinib. In clinical pharmacology studies there was no clinically meaningful effect on the PK of baricitinib when co-administered with cyclosporine (Pgp and BCRP inhibitor). Co-administration with methotrexate (substrate of several transporters) did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the PK of baricitinib.</p><p>Exposure changes of baricitinib following co-administration with CYP inhibitors or inducers, transporter inhibitors, as well as methotrexate and the proton pump inhibitor, omeprazole, are shown in Figure 3.</p><p>Figure 3: Impact of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Baricitinibb</p><p>a Values are based on simulated studies.</p><p>b Reference group is administration of baricitinib alone.</p>",

      "useInSpecificPopulations": "<h1>8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h1><h2>8.1 Pregnancy</h2><p>Risk Summary</p><p>Based on the findings from animal reproduction studies, OLUMIANT may cause fetal harm during pregnancy. Available data from clinical trials and postmarketing case reports with OLUMIANT exposure in pregnancy are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are no human data on chronic baricitinib exposure throughout pregnancy. There are risks to the mother and the fetus associated with rheumatoid arthritis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). Consider the risks and benefits with chronic use of OLUMIANT during pregnancy.</p><p>In animal embryo-fetal development studies, oral baricitinib administration to pregnant rats and rabbits at exposures equal to and greater than approximately 11 and 46 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 4 mg/day, respectively, resulted in reduced fetal body weights, increased embryolethality (rabbits only), and dose-related increases in skeletal malformations. No developmental toxicity was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits treated with oral baricitinib during organogenesis at approximately 2 and 7 times the exposure at the MRHD, respectively. In a pre- and post-natal development study in pregnant female rats, oral baricitinib administration at exposures approximately 24 times the MRHD resulted in reduction in pup viability (increased incidence of stillborn pups and early neonatal deaths), decreased fetal birth weight, reduced fetal body weight gain, decreased cytotoxic T cells on post-natal day (PND) 35 with evidence of recovery by PND 65, and developmental delays that might be attributable to decreased body weight gain. No developmental toxicity was observed at an exposure approximately 5times the exposure at the MRHD (see Data).</p><p>The background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</p><p>Report pregnancies to Eli Lilly and Company at 1-800-LillyRx (1-800-545-5979).</p><p>Clinical Considerations</p><p>Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk</p><p>Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with rheumatoid arthritis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth.</p><p>Data</p><p>Animal Data</p><p>In an embryofetal development study in pregnant rats, dosed orally during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6 to 17, baricitinib was teratogenic (skeletal malformations that consisted of bent limb bones and rib anomalies) at exposures equal to or greater than approximately 11 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses of 10mg/kg/day and higher). No developmental toxicity was observed in rats at an exposure approximately 2times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 2mg/kg/day).</p><p>In an embryofetal development study in pregnant rabbits, dosed orally during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7 to 20, embryolethality, decreased fetal body weights, and skeletal malformations (rib anomalies) were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity at an exposure approximately 46times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 30mg/kg/day). Embryolethality consisted of increased post-implantation loss that was due to elevated incidences of both early and late resorptions. No developmental toxicity was observed in rabbits at an exposure approximately 7times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 10mg/kg/day).</p><p>In a pre- and post-natal development study in pregnant female rats dosed orally from gestation day 6 through lactation day 20, adverse findings observed in pups included decreased survival from birth to post-natal day 4 (due to increased stillbirths and early neonatal deaths), decreased birth weight, decreased body weight gain during the pre-weaning phase, increased incidence of malrotated forelimbs during the pre-weaning phase, and decreased cytotoxic Tcells on PND 35 with recovery by PND 65 at exposures approximately 24 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 25mg/kg/day). Developmental delays (that may be secondary to decreased body weight gain) were observed in males and females at exposures approximately 24 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 25mg/kg/day). These findings included decreased forelimb and hindlimb grip strengths, and delayed mean age of sexual maturity. No developmental toxicity was observed in rats at an exposure approximately 5times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 5mg/kg/day).</p><h2>8.2 Lactation</h2><p>Risk Summary</p><p>No information is available on the presence of OLUMIANT in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. Baricitinib is present in the milk of lactating rats (see Data). Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with OLUMIANT and for 4 days after the last dose (approximately 5 to 6 elimination half-lives).</p><p>Data</p><p>A single oral dose of 25mg/kg radiolabeled baricitinib was administered to lactating female Sprague-Dawley rats on post-partum day 13. Drug exposure was approximately 45-fold greater in milk than in plasma based on AUC0-t values.</p><h2>8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h2><p>Contraception</p><p>Based on animal studies, OLUMIANT may cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Consider pregnancy planning and prevention for females of reproductive potential.</p><h2>8.4 Pediatric Use</h2><p>The safety and effectiveness of OLUMIANT in pediatric patients have not been established.</p><h2>8.5 Geriatric Use</h2><p>Of the 3100 patients treated in the rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials, a total of 537patients were 65years of age and older, including 71patients 75years of age and older. Of the 2558 patients treated in the COVID-19 clinical trials, a total of 791 were 65 years of age and older, including 295 patients 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</p><p>Of the 1200 patients in the alopecia areata clinical trials, a total of 29 patients were 65 years of age or older.

No evidence of tumorigenicity was observed in Tg.rasH2 mice that received baricitinib for 26 weeks at oral doses up to 300 and 150mg/kg/day in male and female mice, respectively.</p><p>Baricitinib tested negative in the following genotoxicity assays: the in vitro bacterial mutagenicity assay (Ames assay), in vitro chromosome aberration assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes, and in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay.</p><p>Fertility (achievement of pregnancy) was reduced in male and female rats that received baricitinib at oral doses of 50 and 100mg/kg/day respectively (approximately 62 and 93 times the MRHD in males and females, respectively, on an AUC basis) based upon findings that 7 of 19 (36.8%) drug-treated females with evidence of mating were not gravid compared to 1 of 19 (5.3%) control females. It could not be determined from the study design if these findings were attributable to toxicities in one sex or both. Fertility was unaffected in male and female rats at oral doses of 15mg/kg and 25mg/kg, respectively (approximately 13 and 26 times the MRHD on an AUC basis). However, maintenance of pregnancy was adversely affected at these doses based upon findings of increased post-implantation losses (early resorptions) and decreased numbers of mean viable embryos per litter. The number of viable embryos was unaffected in female rats that received baricitinib at an oral dose of 5mg/kg/day and were mated to males that received the same dose (approximately 6 times the MRHD on an AUC basis). Reproductive performance was unaffected in male and female rats that received baricitinib at oral doses up to 50 and 100mg/kg/day respectively (approximately 62 and 93 times the MRHD in males and females, respectively, on an AUC basis).</p>",
      "mechanismOfAction": "<h2>12.1 Mechanism of Action</h2><p>Baricitinib is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. JAKs are intracellular enzymes which transmit signals arising from cytokine or growth factor-receptor interactions on the cellular membrane to influence cellular processes of hematopoiesis and immune cell function. Within the signaling pathway, JAKs phosphorylate and activate Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs) which modulate intracellular activity including gene expression. Baricitinib modulates the signaling pathway at the point of JAKs, preventing the phosphorylation and activation of STATs.</p><p>JAK enzymes transmit cytokine signaling through their pairing (e.g., JAK1/JAK2, JAK1/JAK3, JAK1/TYK2, JAK2/JAK2, JAK2/TYK2). In cell-free isolated enzyme assays, baricitinib had greater inhibitory potency at JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 relative to JAK3. In human leukocytes, baricitinib inhibited cytokine induced STAT phosphorylation mediated by JAK1/JAK2, JAK1/JAK3, JAK1/TYK2, or JAK2/TYK2 with comparable potencies. However, the relevance of inhibition of specific JAK enzymes to therapeutic effectiveness is not currently known.</p>",

      "warningsAndPrecautions": "\n<h3>5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-Cell Tumors</h3>\n<p>In both sexes of rats, tirzepatide caused a dose-dependent and treatment-duration-dependent increase in the incidence of thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and carcinomas) in a 2-year study at clinically relevant plasma exposures. It is unknown whether MOUNJARO causes thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans as human relevance of tirzepatide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined.</p>\n<p>MOUNJARO is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of MOUNJARO and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness).</p>\n<p>Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with MOUNJARO. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to the low test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin values may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values greater than 50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated.</p>\n<h3>5.2 Pancreatitis</h3>\n<p>Acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, has been observed in patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists.</p>\n<p>In clinical studies, 14 events of acute pancreatitis were confirmed by adjudication in 13 MOUNJARO-treated patients (0.23 patients per 100 years of exposure) versus 3 events in 3 comparator-treated patients (0.11 patients per 100 years of exposure). MOUNJARO has not been studied in patients with a prior history of pancreatitis. It is unknown if patients with a history of pancreatitis are at higher risk for development of pancreatitis on MOUNJARO.</p>\n<p>After initiation of MOUNJARO, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, discontinue MOUNJARO and initiate appropriate management.</p>\n<h3>5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin</h3>\n<p>Patients receiving MOUNJARO in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia.</p>\n<p>The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogue) or insulin. Inform patients using these concomitant medications of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.</p>\n<h3>5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3>\n<p>Serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema) have been reported in patients treated with MOUNJARO. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of MOUNJARO; treat promptly per standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. Do not use in patients with a previous serious hypersensitivity reaction to tirzepatide or any of the excipients in MOUNJARO.</p>\n<p>Anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported with GLP-1 receptor agonists. Use caution in patients with a history of angioedema or anaphylaxis with a GLP-1 receptor agonist because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to these reactions with MOUNJARO.</p>\n<h3>5.5 Acute Kidney Injury</h3>\n<p>MOUNJARO has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, which include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. These events may lead to dehydration, which if severe could cause acute kidney injury.</p>\n<p>In patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, there have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury and worsening of chronic renal failure, which may sometimes require hemodialysis. Some of these events have been reported in patients without known underlying renal disease. A majority of the reported events occurred in patients who had experienced nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration. Monitor renal function when initiating or escalating doses of MOUNJARO in patients with renal impairment reporting severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions.</p>\n<h3>5.6 Severe Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions</h3>\n<p>Use of MOUNJARO has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, sometimes severe. In the pool of placebo-controlled trials, severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions occurred more frequently among patients receiving MOUNJARO (5 mg 1.3%, 10 mg 0.4%, 15 mg 1.2%) than placebo (0.9%).</p>\n<p>MOUNJARO has not been studied in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease, including severe gastroparesis, and is therefore not recommended in these patients.</p>\n<h3>5.7 Diabetic Retinopathy Complications in Patients with a History of Diabetic Retinopathy</h3>\n<p>Rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. MOUNJARO has not been studied in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy requiring acute therapy, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, or diabetic macular edema. Patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy should be monitored for progression of diabetic retinopathy.</p>\n<h3>5.8 Acute Gallbladder Disease</h3>\n<p>Acute events of gallbladder disease such as cholelithiasis or cholecystitis have been reported in GLP-1 receptor agonist trials and postmarketing.</p>\n<p>In MOUNJARO placebo-controlled clinical trials, acute gallbladder disease (cholelithiasis, biliary colic, and cholecystectomy) was reported by 0.6% of MOUNJARO-treated patients and 0% of placebo-treated patients. If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder diagnostic studies and appropriate clinical follow-up are indicated.</p>\n<h3>5.9 Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation</h3>\n<p>MOUNJARO delays gastric emptying. There have been rare postmarketing reports of pulmonary aspiration in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures requiring general anesthesia or deep sedation who had residual gastric contents despite reported adherence to preoperative fasting recommendations.</p>\n<p>Available data are insufficient to inform recommendations to mitigate the risk of pulmonary aspiration during general anesthesia or deep sedation in patients taking MOUNJARO, including whether modifying preoperative fasting recommendations or temporarily discontinuing MOUNJARO could reduce the incidence of retained gastric contents. Instruct patients to inform healthcare providers prior to any planned surgeries or procedures if they are taking MOUNJARO.</p>",

      "clinicalPharmacology": "<h1>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1><h2>12.1 Mechanism of Action</h2><p>Tirzepatide is a GIP receptor and GLP-1 receptor agonist. It is an amino-acid sequence including a C20 fatty diacid that enables albumin binding and prolongs the half-life. Tirzepatide selectively binds to and activates both the GIP and GLP-1 receptors, the targets for native GIP and GLP-1.</p><p>Tirzepatide enhances first- and second-phase insulin secretion, and reduces glucagon levels, both in a glucose-dependent manner.</p><h2>12.2 Pharmacodynamics</h2><p>Tirzepatide lowers fasting and postprandial glucose concentration, decreases food intake, and reduces body weight in patients with type2 diabetes mellitus.</p><p>First and Second-Phase Insulin Secretion</p><p>Tirzepatide enhances the first- and second-phase insulin secretion. (Figure1)</p><p>Figure 1: Mean insulin concentration at 0-120 minutes during hyperglycemic clamp at baseline and Week 28</p><p>Insulin Sensitivity</p><p>Tirzepatide increases insulin sensitivity, as demonstrated in a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp study after 28 weeks of treatment.</p><p>Glucagon Secretion</p><p>Tirzepatide reduces fasting and postprandial glucagon concentrations. Tirzepatide 15mg reduced fasting glucagon concentration by 28% and glucagon AUC after a mixed meal by 43%, compared with no change for placebo after 28 weeks of treatment.</p><p>Gastric Emptying</p><p>Tirzepatide delays gastric emptying. The delay is largest after the first dose and this effect diminishes over time. Tirzepatide slows post-meal glucose absorption, reducing postprandial glucose.</p><h2>12.3 Pharmacokinetics</h2><p>The pharmacokinetics of tirzepatide is similar between healthy subjects and patients with type2 diabetes mellitus. Steady-state plasma tirzepatide concentrations were achieved following 4 weeks of once weekly administration. Tirzepatide exposure increases in a dose-proportional manner.</p><p>Absorption</p><p>Following subcutaneous administration, the time to maximum plasma concentration of tirzepatide ranges from 8 to 72 hours. The mean absolute bioavailability of tirzepatide following subcutaneous administration is 80%. Similar exposure was achieved with subcutaneous administration of tirzepatide in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm.</p><p>Distribution</p><p>The mean apparent steady-state volume of distribution of tirzepatide following subcutaneous administration in patients with type2 diabetes mellitus is approximately 10.3L. Tirzepatide is highly bound to plasma albumin (99%).</p><p>Elimination</p><p>The apparent population mean clearance of tirzepatide is 0.061L/h with an elimination half-life of approximately 5 days, enabling once-weekly dosing.</p><p>Metabolism</p><p>Tirzepatide is metabolized by proteolytic cleavage of the peptide backbone, beta-oxidation of the C20 fatty diacid and amide hydrolysis.</p><p>Excretion</p><p>The primary excretion routes of tirzepatide metabolites are via urine and feces. Intact tirzepatide is not observed in urine or feces.</p><p>Specific Populations</p><p>The intrinsic factors of age, gender, race, ethnicity, or body weight do not have a clinically relevant effect on the PK of tirzepatide.</p><p>Patients with Renal Impairment</p><p>Renal impairment does not impact the pharmacokinetics of tirzepatide. The pharmacokinetics of tirzepatide after a single 5mg dose was evaluated in patients with different degrees of renal impairment (mild, moderate, severe, ESRD) compared with subjects with normal renal function. This was also shown for patients with both type2 diabetes mellitus and renal impairment based on data from clinical studies [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].</p><p>Patients with Hepatic Impairment</p><p>Hepatic impairment does not impact the pharmacokinetics of tirzepatide. The pharmacokinetics of tirzepatide after a single 5mg dose was evaluated in patients with different degrees of hepatic impairment (mild, moderate, severe) compared with subjects with normal hepatic function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].</p><p>Drug Interactions Studies</p><p>Potential for Tirzepatide to Influence the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs</p><p>In vitro studies have shown low potential for tirzepatide to inhibit or induce CYP enzymes, and to inhibit drug transporters.</p><p>MOUNJARO delays gastric emptying, and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].</p><p>The impact of tirzepatide on gastric emptying was greatest after a single dose of 5mg and diminished after subsequent doses.</p><p>Following a first dose of tirzepatide 5mg, acetaminophen maximum concentration (Cmax) was reduced by 50%, and the median peak plasma concentration (tmax) occurred 1 hour later. After coadministration at week 4, there was no meaningful impact on acetaminophen Cmax and tmax. Overall acetaminophen exposure (AUC0-24hr) was not influenced.</p><p>Following administration of a combined oral contraceptive (0.035mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.25mg norgestimate) in the presence of a single dose of tirzepatide 5mg, mean Cmax of ethinyl estradiol, norgestimate, and norelgestromin was reduced by 59%,66%, and 55%, while mean AUC was reduced by 20%, 21%, and 23%, respectively. A delay in tmax of 2.5 to 4.5hours was observed.</p><h2>12.6 Immunogenicity</h2><p>The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the trials described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other trials.</p><p>During the 40- to 104-week treatment periods with ADA sampling conducted up to 44 to 108 weeks in seven clinical trials in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Clinical Studies (14)], 51% (2,570/5,025) of MOUNJARO-treated patients developed anti-tirzepatide antibodies. In these trials, anti-tirzepatide antibody formation in 34% and 14% of MOUNJARO-treated patients showed cross-reactivity to native GIP or native GLP-1, respectively.</p><p>Of the 2,570 MOUNJARO-treated patients who developed anti-tirzepatide antibodies during the treatment periods in these seven trials, 2% and 2% developed neutralizing antibodies against tirzepatide activity on the GIP or GLP-1 receptors, respectively, and 0.9% and 0.4% developed neutralizing antibodies against native GIP or GLP-1, respectively.</p><p>There was no identified clinically significant effect of anti-tirzepatide antibodies on pharmacokinetics or effectiveness of MOUNJARO. More MOUNJARO-treated patients who developed anti-tirzepatide antibodies experienced hypersensitivity reactions or injection site reactions than those who did not develop these antibodies [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</p>",

There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). Based on animal reproduction studies, there may be risks to the fetus from exposure to tirzepatide during pregnancy. MOUNJARO should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><p>In pregnant rats administered tirzepatide during organogenesis, fetal growth reductions and fetal abnormalities occurred at clinical exposure in maternal rats based on AUC. In rabbits administered tirzepatide during organogenesis, fetal growth reductions were observed at clinically relevant exposures based on AUC. These adverse embryo/fetal effects in animals coincided with pharmacological effects on maternal weight and food consumption (see Data).</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 610% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with an HbA1c &gt;7% and has been reported to be as high as 2025% in women with an HbA1c &gt;10%. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 24% and 1520%, respectively.</p><p>Clinical Considerations</p><p>Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk</p><p>Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia-related morbidity.</p><p>Data</p><p>Animal Data</p><p>In pregnant rats given twice weekly subcutaneous doses of 0.02, 0.1, and 0.5mg/kg tirzepatide (0.03-, 0.07-, and 0.5-fold the MRHD of 15mg once weekly based on AUC) during organogenesis, increased incidences of external, visceral, and skeletal malformations, increased incidences of visceral and skeletal developmental variations, and decreased fetal weights coincided with pharmacologically-mediated reductions in maternal body weights and food consumption at 0.5mg/kg. In pregnant rabbits given once weekly subcutaneous doses of 0.01, 0.03, or 0.1mg/kg tirzepatide (0.01-, 0.06-, and 0.2-fold the MRHD) during organogenesis, pharmacologically-mediated effects on the gastrointestinal system resulting in maternal mortality or abortion in a few rabbits occurred at all dose levels. Reduced fetal weights associated with decreased maternal food consumption and body weights were observed at 0.1mg/kg. In a pre- and post-natal study in rats administered subcutaneous doses of 0.02, 0.10, or 0.25 mg/kg tirzepatide twice weekly from implantation through lactation, F1 pups from F0 maternal rats given 0.25mg/kg tirzepatide had statistically significant lower mean body weight when compared to controls from post-natal day 7 through post-natal day 126 for males and post-natal day 56 for females.</p><h2>8.2 Lactation</h2><p>Risk Summary</p><p>There are no data on the presence of tirzepatide in animal or human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for MOUNJARO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from MOUNJARO or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h2>8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h2><p>Contraception</p><p>Use of MOUNJARO may reduce the efficacy of oral hormonal contraceptives due to delayed gastric emptying. This delay is largest after the first dose and diminishes over time. Advise patients using oral hormonal contraceptives to switch to a non-oral contraceptive method, or add a barrier method of contraception for 4 weeks after initiation and for 4 weeks after each dose escalation with MOUNJARO [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2, 12.3)].</p><h2>8.4 Pediatric Use</h2><p>Safety and effectiveness of MOUNJARO have not been established in pediatric patients.</p><h2>8.5 Geriatric Use</h2><p>In the pool of seven clinical trials, 1539 (30.1%) MOUNJARO-treated patients were 65 years of age or older, and 212 (4.1%) MOUNJARO-treated patients were 75 years of age or older at baseline.</p><p>No overall differences in safety or efficacy were detected between these patients and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p><h2>8.6 Renal Impairment</h2><p>No dosage adjustment of MOUNJARO is recommended for patients with renal impairment. In subjects with renal impairment including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), no change in tirzepatide pharmacokinetics (PK) was observed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Monitor renal function when initiating or escalating doses of MOUNJARO in patients with renal impairment reporting severe adverse gastrointestinal reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].</p><h2>8.7 Hepatic Impairment</h2><p>No dosage adjustment of MOUNJARO is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment. In a clinical pharmacology study in subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment, no change in tirzepatide PK was observed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</p>",

In the clinical trial, Grade 3 or higher infections occurred in 24% of 593 patients, most commonly pneumonia (14%), with fatal infections occurring in 4.4% of patients. Sepsis occurred in 6% of patients and febrile neutropenia in 4%. In patients with CLL/SLL, Grade 3 or higher infections occurred in 32% of patients, with fatal infections occurring in 8%. Opportunistic infections after treatment with JAYPIRCA have included, but are not limited to, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and fungal infection [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</p>\n<p>Consider prophylaxis, including vaccinations and antimicrobial prophylaxis, in patients who are at increased risk for infections, including opportunistic infections. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection, evaluate promptly, and treat appropriately. Based on severity, reduce dose, temporarily withhold, or permanently discontinue JAYPIRCA [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].</p>\n<h3>5.2 Hemorrhage</h3>\n<p>Fatal and serious hemorrhage has occurred with JAYPIRCA. Major hemorrhage, defined as Grade 3 or higher bleeding or any central nervous system bleeding, occurred in 3% of 593 patients treated with JAYPIRCA, including gastrointestinal hemorrhage; fatal hemorrhage occurred in 0.3% of patients. Bleeding of any grade, excluding bruising and petechiae, occurred in 17% of patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</p>\n<p>Major hemorrhage occurred in 2.3% of patients taking JAYPIRCA without antithrombotic agents and 0.7% of patients taking JAYPIRCA with antithrombotic agents. Consider the risks and benefits of antithrombotic agents when co-administered with JAYPIRCA. Monitor patients for signs of bleeding. Based on severity of bleeding, reduce dose, temporarily withhold, or permanently discontinue JAYPIRCA [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].</p>\n<p>Consider the benefit-risk of withholding JAYPIRCA for 3 to 7 days pre- and post-surgery depending upon the type of surgery and risk of bleeding.</p>\n<h3>5.3 Cytopenias</h3>\n<p>JAYPIRCA can cause cytopenias, including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia.</p>\n<p>In the clinical trial, Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias, including decreased neutrophils (26%), decreased platelets (12%), and decreased hemoglobin (12%) developed in patients treated with JAYPIRCA.

      "clinicalPharmacology": "<h1>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1><h2>12.1 Mechanism of action</h2><p>Pirtobrutinib is a small molecule, noncovalent inhibitor of BTK. BTK is a signaling protein of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. In B-cells, BTK signaling results in activation of pathways necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion. Pirtobrutinib binds to wild type BTK and BTK harboring C481 mutations, leading to inhibition of BTK kinase activity. In nonclinical studies, pirtobrutinib inhibited BTK-mediated B-cell CD69 expression and inhibited malignant B-cell proliferation. Pirtobrutinib showed dose-dependent anti-tumor activities in BTK wild type and BTK C481S mutant mouse xenograft models.</p><h2>12.2 Pharmacodynamics</h2><p>At the recommended dosage of 200 mg once daily, pirtobrutinib trough concentrations exceeded the BTK IC96. BTK occupancy is maintained throughout the dosing interval, regardless of the intrinsic rate of BTK turnover.</p><p>Cardiac Electrophysiology</p><p>The effect of a single 900 mg dose of pirtobrutinib (equivalent to approximately 2 times higher than the concentrations achieved at steady state at the recommended dosage of 200 mg once daily) on the QTc interval was evaluated in a placebo-controlled and positive-controlled study in 30 healthy subjects. Pirtobrutinib had no clinically meaningful effect on the change in QTcF interval (i.e., &gt; 10 ms) and there was no relationship between pirtobrutinib exposure and change in QTc interval.</p><h2>12.3 Pharmacokinetics</h2><p>The pharmacokinetics of pirtobrutinib were characterized in healthy subjects and in patients with cancer. Pirtobrutinib exposure (AUC) and Cmax increases proportionally following single oral doses ranging from 300 mg to 800 mg (1.5 to 4times the approved recommended dosage) and once daily doses ranging from 25 300 mg (0.125 to 1.5 times the recommended dosage). Steady state was achieved within 5 days of once daily dosing, and the mean (CV%) accumulation ratio was 1.63 (26.7%) based on AUC after administration of 200 mg dosages.</p><p>Following administration of the recommended dosage, the geometric mean (CV%) steady-state AUC and Cmax of pirtobrutinib were 90300 h*ng/mL (40%) and 6380 ng/mL (26%), respectively. The geometric mean (CV%) AUC0-24 and Cmax of pirtobrutinib on Cycle 1 Day 8 were 81800 h*ng/mL (66.6%) and 3670 ng/mL (89.5%), respectively.</p><p>Absorption</p><p>The absolute bioavailability of pirtobrutinib after a single oral 200 mg dose is 85.5% (range 75.9% to 90.9%).

      "clinicalPharmacology": "<h1>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1><h2>12.1 Mechanism of Action</h2><p>Lebrikizumab-lbkz is an IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity and slow off-rate to interleukin (IL)-13 and allows IL-13 to bind to IL-13R1 but inhibits human IL-13 signaling through the IL-4R/IL-13R1 receptor complex. IL-13 is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in Type 2 inflammation, which is an important component in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis. Lebrikizumab-lbkz inhibits IL-13-induced responses including the release of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and IgE. Lebrikizumab-lbkz-bound IL-13 can still bind IL-13R2 allowing subsequent internalization and natural clearance of IL-13.</p><h2>12.2 Pharmacodynamics</h2><p>In clinical studies, lebrikizumab-lbkz reduced the levels of serum periostin, total immunoglobulin E (IgE), CCchemokine ligand (CCL)17 [thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC)], CCL18 [pulmonary and activation-regulated chemokine (PARC)], and CCL13 [monocyte chemotactic protein-4 (MCP-4)]. The clinical relevance of these biomarkers is not completely understood.</p><h2>12.3 Pharmacokinetics</h2><p>Lebrikizumab-lbkz steady-state exposure following either a subcutaneous dose of 250mg every 2 weeks or every 4weeks in patients with atopic dermatitis are presented in Table 2.

      "mechanismOfAction": "<h2>12.1 Mechanism of Action</h2><p>Lebrikizumab-lbkz is an IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity and slow off-rate to interleukin (IL)-13 and allows IL-13 to bind to IL-13R1 but inhibits human IL-13 signaling through the IL-4R/IL-13R1 receptor complex. IL-13 is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in Type 2 inflammation, which is an important component in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis. Lebrikizumab-lbkz inhibits IL-13-induced responses including the release of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and IgE. Lebrikizumab-lbkz-bound IL-13 can still bind IL-13R2 allowing subsequent internalization and natural clearance of IL-13.</p>",

      "warningsAndPrecautions": "\n<h3>5.1 Infections</h3>\n<p>TALTZ may increase the risk of infection. In clinical trials in adult patients with plaque psoriasis, the TALTZ group had a higher rate of infections than the placebo group, with 27% in the TALTZ group compared to 23% in the placebo group. Upper respiratory tract infections, oral candidiasis, conjunctivitis, and tinea infections occurred more frequently in the TALTZ group than in the placebo group. A similar increase in risk of infection was seen in placebo-controlled trials in patients with pediatric psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</p>\n<p>In the postmarketing setting, serious bacterial, viral, and fungal opportunistic infections have been reported in patients receiving IL-17 inhibitors, including TALTZ. Instruct patients treated with TALTZ to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of clinically important chronic or acute infection occur. If a patient develops a serious infection or is not responding to standard therapy, monitor the patient closely and discontinue TALTZ until the infection resolves.</p>\n<h3>5.2 Pre-treatment Evaluation for Tuberculosis</h3>\n<p>Evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with TALTZ. Do not administer to patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering TALTZ. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiating TALTZ in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Patients receiving TALTZ should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after treatment.</p>\n<h3>5.3 Hypersensitivity</h3>\n<p>Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and urticaria, each occurring at a rate of 0.1%, occurred in the TALTZ group in clinical trials. Anaphylaxis, including cases leading to hospitalization, has been reported in postmarketing use with TALTZ [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.3)]. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue TALTZ immediately and initiate appropriate therapy.</p>\n<h3>5.4 Eczematous Eruptions</h3>\n<p>In the postmarketing setting, cases of severe eczematous eruptions, including atopic dermatitis-like eruptions, dyshidrotic eczema, and erythroderma, were reported in patients receiving TALTZ; some cases resulted in hospitalization. The onset of eczematous eruptions was variable, ranging from days to months after the first dose of TALTZ. Treatment may need to be discontinued to resolve the eczematous eruption. Some patients with limited psoriasis treatment options were successfully treated for eczema while continuing TALTZ.</p>\n<h3>5.5 Inflammatory Bowel Disease</h3>\n<p>Patients treated with TALTZ may be at increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease. In clinical trials, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, including exacerbations, occurred at a greater frequency in the TALTZ group than the placebo control group [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. During TALTZ treatment, monitor for onset or exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease, and if IBD occurs, discontinue TALTZ and initiate appropriate medical management.</p>\n<h3>5.6 Immunizations</h3>\n<p>Prior to initiating therapy with TALTZ, consider completion of all age-appropriate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines. Avoid use of live vaccines in patients treated with TALTZ. No data are available on the response to live vaccines.</p>",

In subjects treated with TALTZ, the incidence rate of neutropenia during Weeks 13 to 60 was lower than the incidence rate during Weeks 0 to 12.</p>\n<p>In the 12-week, placebo-controlled period, neutropenia Grade 3 (&lt;1,000 cells/mm3) occurred in 0.2% of the TALTZ group (0.007 per subject-year of follow-up) compared to 0.1% of the placebo group (0.006 per subject-year of follow-up). The majority of cases of neutropenia were either Grade 2 (2% for TALTZ 80mg Q2W versus 0.3% for placebo; 1,000 to &lt;1,500 cells/mm3) or Grade 1 (7% for TALTZ 80mg Q2W versus 3% for placebo; 1,500 cells/mm3 to 2,000 cells/mm3). Neutropenia in the TALTZ group was not associated with an increased rate of infection compared to the placebo group.</p>\n<p>Thrombocytopenia</p>\n<p>Ninety eight percent of cases of thrombocytopenia were Grade 1 (3% for TALTZ 80mg Q2W versus 1% for placebo; 75,000 cells/mm3 to &lt;150,000 cells/mm3). Thrombocytopenia in subjects treated with TALTZ was not associated with an increased rate of bleeding compared to subjects treated with placebo.</p>\n<p>Active Comparator Trials</p>\n<p>In the two clinical trials that included an active comparator, the rate of serious adverse events during weeks zero to twelve was 0.7% for U.S. approved etanercept and 2% for TALTZ 80mg Q2W, and the rate of discontinuation from adverse events was 0.7% for U.S. approved etanercept and 2% for TALTZ 80mg Q2W. The incidence of infections was 18% for U.S. approved etanercept and 26% for TALTZ 80mg Q2W. The rate of serious infections was 0.3% for both TALTZ 80mg Q2W and U.S. approved etanercept.</p>\n<p>Pediatric Plaque Psoriasis</p>\n<p>TALTZ was evaluated in a placebo-controlled trial in pediatric subjects with moderate-to-severe psoriasis 6 to less than 18 years of age. A total of 171 subjects were studied (115 subjects on TALTZ and 56 subjects on placebo). Overall, the safety profile observed in pediatric subjects with plaque psoriasis treated with TALTZ every 4 weeks is consistent with the safety profile in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis with the exception of the frequencies of conjunctivitis (2.6%), influenza (1.7%), and urticaria (1.7%).</p>\n<p>In this clinical trial, Crohn's disease occurred at a greater frequency in the TALTZ group (0.9%) than the placebo group (0%) during the 12-week, placebo-controlled period.

Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with psoriatic arthritis treated with TALTZ Q4W is consistent with the safety profile in adult patients with plaque psoriasis with the exception of the frequencies of influenza (1.3%) and conjunctivitis (1.3%).</p>\n<p>Ankylosing Spondylitis</p>\n<p>TALTZ was studied in two placebo-controlled trials in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. A total of 566 patients were studied (376 patients on TALTZ and 190 on placebo). A total of 195 patients in these trials received TALTZ 80 or 160mg at Week 0, followed by 80mg every 4 weeks (Q4W). Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with ankylosing spondylitis treated with TALTZ Q4W is consistent with the safety profile in adult patients with plaque psoriasis.</p>\n<p>In adult patients with ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, including exacerbations, occurred in 2 patients (1.0%) and 1 patient (0.5%), respectively, in the TALTZ 80mg Q4W group and 1 patient (0.5%) and 0%, respectively, in the placebo group during the 16-week, placebo-controlled period in clinical trials. Of these patients, serious events occurred in 1 patient in the TALTZ 80mg Q4W group and 1 patient in the placebo group [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].</p>\n<p>Non-radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis</p>\n<p>TALTZ was studied in a placebo-controlled trial in patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis. A total of 303 patients were studied (198 patients on TALTZ and 105 on placebo). A total of 96 patients in this trial received TALTZ 80 or 160mg at Week 0, followed by 80 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W). Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis treated with TALTZ 80mg Q4W up to Week 16 is consistent with the previous experience of TALTZ in other indications.</p>\n<h3>6.2 Immunogenicity</h3>\n<p>As with all therapeutic proteins there is the potential for immunogenicity with TALTZ. The assay to test for neutralizing antibodies has limitations detecting neutralizing antibodies in the presence of ixekizumab; therefore, the incidence of neutralizing antibodies development could be underestimated.</p>\n<p>Plaque Psoriasis Population</p>\n<p>By Week 12, approximately 9% of adult subjects treated with TALTZ every 2 weeks developed antibodies to ixekizumab. Approximately 22% of subjects treated with TALTZ at the recommended dosing regimen developed antibodies to ixekizumab during the 60-week treatment period. The clinical effects of antibodies to ixekizumab are dependent on the antibody titer; higher antibody titers were associated with decreasing drug concentration and clinical response.</p>\n<p>Of the adult subjects who developed antibodies to ixekizumab during the 60-week treatment period, approximately 10%, which equates to 2% of subjects treated with TALTZ at the recommended dosing regimen, had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing. Neutralizing antibodies were associated with reduced drug concentrations and loss of efficacy.</p>\n<p>In pediatric psoriasis subjects treated with ixekizumab at the recommended dosing regimen up to 12 weeks, 21 subjects (18%) developed anti-drug antibodies, 5 subjects (4%) had confirmed neutralizing antibodies associated with low drug concentrations. No conclusive evidence could be obtained on the potential association of neutralizing antibodies and clinical response and/or adverse events due to small number of pediatric subjects in the study.</p>\n<p>Psoriatic Arthritis Population</p>\n<p>For subjects treated with TALTZ 80mg every 4 weeks for up to 52 weeks (PsA1), 11% developed anti-drug antibodies, and 8% had confirmed neutralizing antibodies.</p>\n<p>Ankylosing Spondylitis Population</p>\n<p>For patients treated with TALTZ 80mg every 4 weeks for up to 16 weeks (AS1, AS2), 5.2% developed anti-drug antibodies, and 1.5% had neutralizing antibodies.</p>\n<p>Non-radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis Population</p>\n<p>Of patients treated with TALTZ 80mg every 4 weeks for up to 52 weeks (nr-axSpA1), 8.9% developed anti-drug antibodies, all of which were low titer. No patient had neutralizing antibodies.</p>\n<p>The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to TALTZ across indications or with the incidences of antibodies to other products may be misleading.</p>\n<h3>6.3 Postmarketing Experience</h3>\n<p>The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of TALTZ. Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to TALTZ exposure.</p>\n<p>Immune system disorders: anaphylaxis [see Contraindications (4)].</p>\n<p>Infections: bacterial, viral, and fungal opportunistic infections, including cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, esophageal and disseminated mucocutaneous candidiasis, pulmonary tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, varicella zoster virus reactivation, cytomegalovirus colitis, pulmonary aspergillosis.</p>\n<p>Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Eczematous eruptions (erythroderma, atopic dermatitis-like eruptions, and dyshidrotic eczema).</p>",

Patients must have had objective signs of inflammation indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) (defined as greater than 5mg/L), and/or sacroiliitis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and no definitive radiographic evidence of structural damage on sacroiliac joints. Patients had active disease as defined by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) 4, and spinal pain 4 on a 0 to 10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). Patients must have been intolerant to or had an inadequate response to at least two NSAIDs. Patients were treated with either placebo or TALTZ 80mg or 160mg at Week 0, followed by either 80mg every 2weeks (Q2W) or 80mg every 4weeks (Q4W). Initiation and/or dose adjustment of concomitant medications (NSAIDs, cDMARDs, corticosteroids, analgesics) were permitted starting at Week 16. Patients were allowed to transition to use of open-label TALTZ 80mg Q2W starting at Week 16 up to Week 44 at the discretion of the investigator.</p><p>At baseline, patients had symptoms of nr-axSpA for an average of 11years.

Pregnant women exposed to TALTZ are encouraged to enroll in the TALTZ Pregnancy Registry by calling 1-800-284-1695. Contact information for the registry is also available on http://www.pregnancyregistry.lilly.com.</p><p>Risk Summary</p><p>Available data from the published literature and the pharmacovigilance database with TALTZ use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. </p><p>Human IgG is known to cross the placental barrier; therefore, TALTZ may be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus. An embryofetal development study conducted in pregnant monkeys during organogenesis at doses up to 19 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) revealed no evidence of harm to the developing fetus. When dosing was continued until parturition, neonatal deaths were observed at 1.9 times the MRHD [see Data]. The clinical significance of these nonclinical findings is unknown.</p><p>The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.</p><p>Data</p><p>Animal Data</p><p>An embryofetal development study was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys administered ixekizumab. No malformations or embryofetal toxicity were observed in fetuses from pregnant monkeys administered ixekizumab weekly by subcutaneous injection during organogenesis to near parturition at doses up to 19 times the MRHD (on a mg/kg basis of 50mg/kg/week). Ixekizumab crossed the placenta in monkeys.</p><p>In a pre- and post-natal development toxicity study, pregnant cynomolgus monkeys were administered weekly subcutaneous doses of ixekizumab up to 19 times the MRHD from the beginning of organogenesis to parturition. Neonatal deaths occurred in the offspring of two monkeys administered ixekizumab at 1.9 times the MRHD (on a mg/kg basis of 5mg/kg/week) and two monkeys administered ixekizumab at 19 times the MRHD (on a mg/kg basis of 50mg/kg/week). These neonatal deaths were attributed to early delivery, trauma, or congenital defect. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. No ixekizumab-related effects on functional or immunological development were observed in the surviving infants from birth through 6 months of age.</p><h2>8.2 Lactation</h2><p>Risk Summary</p><p>There are no available data on the presence of ixekizumab in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ixekizumab was detected in the milk of lactating cynomolgus monkeys. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for TALTZ and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from TALTZ or from the underlying maternal condition.</p><h2>8.4 Pediatric Use</h2><p>The safety and effectiveness of TALTZ have been established in pediatric subjects aged 6 years to less than 18 years with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The safety and effectiveness of TALTZ in other pediatric indications and for pediatric subjects less than 6 years of age have not been established.</p><h2>8.5 Geriatric Use</h2><p>Of the 4204 adult psoriasis subjects exposed to TALTZ, a total of 301 were 65 years or older, and 36 subjects were 75 years or older. Although no differences in safety or efficacy were observed between older and younger subjects, the number of subjects aged 65 and over is not sufficient to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</p>",
      "description": "<p>Ixekizumab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody with neutralizing activity against IL-17A, produced by recombinant DNA technology. It consists of two identical light chain polypeptides of 219 amino acids each and two identical heavy chain polypeptides of 445 amino acids each, with a molecular weight of 146,158 Daltons. TALTZ injection is a sterile, preservative-free solution for subcutaneous use, available in various dosages: 80 mg in a 1 mL prefilled autoinjector or syringe, 40 mg in a 0.5 mL syringe, and 20 mg in a 0.25 mL syringe. Each dosage form contains ixekizumab, Polysorbate 80, Sucrose, and Water for Injection, with a pH of 5.2 to 6.2. Sodium Hydroxide may be added to adjust pH.</p>",
      "nonclinicalToxicology": "<h1>13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</h1><h2>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2><p>Animal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of TALTZ. Moreover published literature is mixed on potential effects on malignancy risk due to the inhibition of IL-17A activity, the pharmacological action of TALTZ. Some published literature suggests that IL-17A directly promotes cancer cell invasion, suggesting a potential beneficial effect by TALTZ, whereas other reports indicate IL-17A promotes T-cell mediated tumor rejection, suggesting a potential adverse effect by TALTZ. However, neutralization of IL-17A with TALTZ has not been studied in these models. Depletion of IL-17A with a neutralizing antibody inhibited tumor development in mice, suggesting a potential beneficial effect by TALTZ. The relevance of experimental findings in mouse models for malignancy risk in humans is unknown.</p><p>No effects on fertility parameters such as reproductive organs, menstrual cycle length, or sperm analysis were observed in sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys that were administered ixekizumab for 13 weeks at a subcutaneous dose of 50mg/kg/week (19 times the MRHD on a mg/kg basis).

      "warningsAndPrecautions": "\n<h3>5.1 Risk of Thyroid C-cell Tumors</h3>\n<p>In male and female rats, dulaglutide causes a dose-related and treatment-duration-dependent increase in the incidence of thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and carcinomas) after lifetime exposure. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists have induced thyroid C-cell adenomas and carcinomas in mice and rats at clinically relevant exposures. It is unknown whether TRULICITY will cause thyroid C-cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as the human relevance of dulaglutide-induced rodent thyroid C-cell tumors has not been determined.</p>\n<p>One case of MTC was reported in a patient treated with TRULICITY in a clinical trial. This patient had pretreatment calcitonin levels approximately 8 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). An additional case of C-cell hyperplasia with elevated calcitonin levels following treatment was reported in the cardiovascular outcomes trial (REWIND). Cases of MTC in patients treated with liraglutide, another GLP-1 receptor agonist, have been reported in the postmarketing period; the data in these reports are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between MTC and GLP-1 receptor agonist use in humans.</p>\n<p>TRULICITY is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with MEN2. Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the use of TRULICITY and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g., a mass in the neck, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness).</p>\n<p>Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with TRULICITY. Such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to the low test specificity for serum calcitonin and a high background incidence of thyroid disease. Significantly elevated serum calcitonin values may indicate MTC and patients with MTC usually have calcitonin values greater than 50 ng/L. If serum calcitonin is measured and found to be elevated, the patient should be further evaluated. Patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging should also be further evaluated.</p>\n<h3>5.2 Pancreatitis</h3>\n<p>In a pooled analysis from the original registration studies, 12 pancreatitis-related adverse reactions (3.4 cases per 1000 patient years) were reported in patients exposed to TRULICITY versus 3 in non-incretin comparators (2.7 cases per 1000 patient years). An analysis of adjudicated events revealed 5 cases of confirmed pancreatitis in patients exposed to TRULICITY (1.4 cases per 1000 patient years) versus 1 case in non-incretin comparators (0.88 cases per 1000 patient years).</p>\n<p>Based on an analysis of adjudicated events in a clinical trial evaluating Trulicity 1.5 mg, 3 mg, or 4.5 mg once weekly, pancreatitis occurred in 1 patient exposed to TRULICITY 1.5 mg (0.2%), in 2 patients exposed to TRULICITY 3 mg (0.3%), and 3 patients exposed to TRULICITY 4.5 mg (0.5%).</p>\n<p>After initiation of TRULICITY, observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis, including persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back, which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue TRULICITY and initiate appropriate management. If pancreatitis is confirmed, TRULICITY should not be restarted. TRULICITY has not been evaluated in patients with a prior history of pancreatitis. Consider other antidiabetic therapies in patients with a history of pancreatitis.</p>\n<h3>5.3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin</h3>\n<p>Patients receiving TRULICITY in combination with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia.</p>\n<p>The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogue) or insulin. Inform patients using these concomitant medications of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.</p>\n<h3>5.4 Hypersensitivity Reactions</h3>\n<p>There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema in patients treated with TRULICITY. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue TRULICITY; treat promptly per standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. TRULICITY is contraindicated in patients with a previous serious hypersensitivity reaction to dulaglutide or to any of the components of TRULICITY.</p>\n<p>Anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported with other GLP-1 receptor agonists. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema or anaphylaxis with another GLP-1 receptor agonist because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to anaphylaxis with TRULICITY.</p>\n<h3>5.5 Acute Kidney Injury</h3>\n<p>In patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, including TRULICITY, there have been postmarketing reports of acute renal failure and worsening of chronic renal failure, which may sometimes require hemodialysis. Some of these events were reported in patients without known underlying renal disease. A majority of reported events occurred in patients who had experienced nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration. Because these reactions may worsen renal function, use caution when initiating or escalating doses of TRULICITY in patients with renal impairment. Monitor renal function in patients with renal impairment reporting severe adverse gastrointestinal reactions.</p>\n<h3>5.6 Severe Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions</h3>\n<p>Use of TRULICITY has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, sometimes severe. In the pool of placebo-controlled trials, severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions were reported more frequently among patients receiving TRULICITY (0.75 mg 2.2%, 1.5 mg 4.3%) than placebo (1.4%).</p>\n<p>TRULICITY has not been studied in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease, including severe gastroparesis, and is therefore not recommended in these patients.</p>\n<h3>5.7 Diabetic Retinopathy Complications in Patients with a History of Diabetic Retinopathy</h3>\n<p>In a cardiovascular outcomes trial with a median follow-up of 5.4 years involving patients with type 2 diabetes with established cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors, diabetic retinopathy complications occurred in patients treated with TRULICITY 1.5 mg (1.9%) and placebo (1.5%). These events were prospectively ascertained as a secondary composite endpoint. The proportion of patients with diabetic retinopathy complications was larger among patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy at baseline (TRULICITY 8.5%, placebo 6.2%) than among patients without a known history of diabetic retinopathy (TRULICITY 1%, placebo 1%).</p>\n<p>Rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. Patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy should be monitored for progression of diabetic retinopathy.</p>\n<h3>5.8 Acute Gallbladder Disease</h3>\n<p>Acute events of gallbladder disease such as cholelithiasis or cholecystitis have been reported in GLP-1 receptor agonist trials and postmarketing. In a cardiovascular outcomes trial with a median follow-up of 5.4 years, cholelithiasis occurred at a rate of 0.62 per 100 patient-years in TRULICITY-treated patients and 0.56 per 100 patient-years in placebo-treated patients after adjusting for prior cholecystectomy. Serious events of acute cholecystitis were reported in 0.5% and 0.3% of patients on TRULICITY and placebo respectively. If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder studies and appropriate clinical follow-up are indicated.</p>\n<h3>5.9 Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation</h3>\n<p>TRULICITY delays gastric emptying. There have been rare postmarketing reports of pulmonary aspiration in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures requiring general anesthesia or deep sedation who had residual gastric contents despite reported adherence to preoperative fasting recommendations.</p>\n<p>Available data are insufficient to inform recommendations to mitigate the risk of pulmonary aspiration during general anesthesia or deep sedation in patients taking TRULICITY, including whether modifying preoperative fasting recommendations or temporarily discontinuing TRULICITY could reduce the incidence of retained gastric contents. Instruct patients to inform healthcare providers prior to any planned surgeries or procedures if they are taking TRULICITY.</p>",

      "drugInteractions": "<h1>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS</h1><h2>7.1 Oral Medications</h2><p>TRULICITY delays gastric emptying and thus has the potential to reduce the rate of absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. The delay in gastric emptying is dose-dependent but is attenuated with the recommended dose escalation to higher doses of TRULICITY [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. The delay is largest after the first dose and diminishes with subsequent doses. In clinical pharmacology studies, TRULICITY 1.5mg did not affect the absorption of the tested orally administered medications to a clinically relevant degree [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. There is limited experience with the use of concomitant medications in clinical trials with TRULICITY doses of 3mg and 4.5mg.</p><p>Monitor drug levels of oral medications with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., warfarin) when concomitantly administered with TRULICITY.</p><h2>7.2 Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue (e.g., Sulfonylurea) or with Insulin</h2><p>When initiating TRULICITY, consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues (such as sulfonylureas) or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</p>",
      "clinicalPharmacology": "<h1>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1><h2>12.1 Mechanism of Action</h2><p>TRULICITY contains dulaglutide, which is a human GLP-1 receptor agonist with 90% amino acid sequence homology to endogenous human GLP-1 (7-37). Dulaglutide activates the GLP-1 receptor, a membrane-bound cell-surface receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase in pancreatic beta cells. Dulaglutide increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) in beta cells leading to glucose-dependent insulin release. Dulaglutide also decreases glucagon secretion and slows gastric emptying.</p><h2>12.2 Pharmacodynamics</h2><p>TRULICITY lowers fasting glucose and reduces postprandial glucose (PPG) concentrations in patients with type2 diabetes mellitus. The reduction in fasting and postprandial glucose can be observed after a single dose.</p><p>Fasting and Postprandial Glucose</p><p>In a clinical pharmacology study in patients with type2 diabetes mellitus, treatment with once weekly TRULICITY resulted in a reduction of fasting and 2-hour PPG concentrations, and postprandial serum glucose incremental AUC, when compared to placebo (-25.6mg/dL, -59.5mg/dL, and -197mg*h/dL, respectively); these effects were sustained after 6 weeks of dosing with the 1.5mg dose.</p><p>First- and Second-Phase Insulin Secretion</p><p>Both first- and second-phase insulin secretion were increased in patients with type2 diabetes treated with TRULICITY compared with placebo.</p><p>Insulin and Glucagon Secretion</p><p>TRULICITY stimulates glucose-dependent insulin secretion and reduces glucagon secretion. Treatment with TRULICITY 0.75mg and 1.5mg once weekly increased fasting insulin from baseline at Week 26 by 35.38 and 17.50pmol/L, respectively, and C-peptide concentration by 0.09 and 0.07nmol/L, respectively, in a monotherapy trial. In the same trial, fasting glucagon concentration was reduced by 1.71 and 2.05pmol/L from baseline with TRULICITY 0.75mg and 1.5mg, respectively.</p><p>Gastric Motility</p><p>Dulaglutide causes a delay of gastric emptying. The delay in gastric emptying is dose-dependent but is attenuated with adequate dose escalation to higher doses of TRULICITY. The delay is largest after the first dose and diminishes with subsequent doses.</p><p>Cardiac Electrophysiology (QTc)</p><p>The effect of dulaglutide on cardiac repolarization was tested in a thorough QTc study. Dulaglutide did not produce QTc prolongation at doses of 4 and 7mg. The maximum recommended dose is 4.5mg once weekly.</p><h2>12.3 Pharmacokinetics</h2><p>The pharmacokinetics of dulaglutide is similar between healthy subjects and patients with type2 diabetes mellitus. Following subcutaneous administration, the time to maximum plasma concentration of dulaglutide at steady state ranges from 24 to 72 hours, with a median of 48 hours. After reaching steady state, the accumulation ratio was approximately 1.56. Steady-state plasma dulaglutide concentrations were achieved between 2 and 4 weeks following once weekly administration. Site of subcutaneous administration (abdomen, upper arm, and thigh) had no statistically significant effect on the exposure to dulaglutide.</p><p>Absorption The mean absolute bioavailability of dulaglutide following subcutaneous administration of single 0.75mg and 1.5mg doses was 65% and 47%, respectively. Absolute subcutaneous bioavailability for 3mg and 4.5mg doses were estimated to be similar to 1.5mg although this has not been specifically studied. Dulaglutide concentrations increased approximately proportional to dose from 0.75mg to 4.5mg.</p><p>Distribution Apparent population mean central volume of distribution was 3.09L and the apparent population mean peripheral volume of distribution was 5.98L.</p><p>Elimination</p><p>The apparent population mean clearance of dulaglutide was 0.142L/h. The elimination half-life of dulaglutide was approximately 5 days.</p><p>Metabolism Dulaglutide is presumed to be degraded into its component amino acids by general protein catabolism pathways.</p><p>Specific Populations</p><p>The intrinsic factors of age ( 65 years), sex, race, ethnicity, body weight, or renal or hepatic impairment did not have a clinically relevant effect on the PK of dulaglutide as shown in Figure1.</p><p>Abbreviations: AUC = area under the time-concentration curve; CI = confidence interval; Cmax = maximum concentration; ESRD = end-stage renal disease; PK = pharmacokinetics.</p><p>Note: Reference values for weight, age, gender, and race comparisons are 93kg, 56 years old, male, and white, respectively; reference groups for renal and hepatic impairment data are subjects with normal renal and hepatic function from the respective clinical pharmacology studies. The weight values shown in the plot (70 and 120kg) are the 10th and 90th percentiles of weight in the PK population.</p><p>Figure1: Impact of intrinsic factors on dulaglutide pharmacokinetics.</p><p>Pediatric Patients</p><p>A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted for dulaglutide 0.75mg and 1.5mg using data from 128 pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with type2 diabetes mellitus. The AUC in pediatric patients was approximately 37% lower than that in adult patients. However, this difference was not determined to be clinically meaningful.</p><p>Patients with Renal Impairment</p><p>Dulaglutide systemic exposure was increased by 20, 28, 14 and 12% for mild, moderate, severe, and ESRD renal impairment sub-groups, respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. The corresponding values for increase in Cmax were 13, 23, 20 and 11%, respectively (Figure1). Additionally, in a 52 week clinical trial in patients with type2 diabetes mellitus and moderate to severe renal impairment, the PK behavior of TRULICITY 0.75mg and 1.5mg once weekly was similar to that demonstrated in previous clinical studies [see Warning and Precautions (5.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].</p><p>Patients with Hepatic Impairment</p><p>Dulaglutide systemic exposure decreased by 23, 33 and 21% for mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment groups, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function, and Cmax was decreased by a similar magnitude (Figure1) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].</p><p>Drug Interaction Studies</p><p>The potential effect of co-administered medications on the PK of dulaglutide 1.5mg and vice versa was studied in several single- and multiple-dose studies in healthy subjects, patients with type2 diabetes mellitus, and patients with hypertension.</p><p>Potential for Dulaglutide to Influence the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs</p><p>Dulaglutide slows gastric emptying and, as a result, may reduce the extent and rate of absorption of orally co-administered medications. In clinical pharmacology studies, dulaglutide at a dose of 1.5mg did not affect the absorption of the tested orally administered medications to any clinically relevant degree. The delay in gastric emptying is dose-dependent but is attenuated with the recommended dose escalation to higher doses of TRULICITY [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)]. The delay is largest after the first dose and diminishes with subsequent doses. PK measures indicating the magnitude of these interactions are presented in Figure2.</p><p>Abbreviations: AUC = area under the time-concentration curve; CI = confidence interval; Cmax = maximum concentration; PK = pharmacokinetics.</p><p>Note: Reference group is co-administered medication given alone.</p><p>Figure2: Impact of dulaglutide 1.5mg on the pharmacokinetics of co-administered medications.</p><p>Potential for Co-administered Drugs to Influence the Pharmacokinetics of Dulaglutide</p><p>In a clinical pharmacology study, the co-administration of a single dose of 1.5mg dulaglutide with steady-state dose of 100mg sitagliptin caused an increase in dulaglutide AUC and Cmax of approximately 38% and 27%, which is not considered clinically relevant.</p><h2>12.6 Immunogenicity</h2><p>The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies.</p><p>In glycemic control trials in adults with type2 diabetes mellitus (monotherapy and combination therapy) [see Clinical Studies (14.2, 14.3)], during a treatment period ranging from 24 to 104 weeks, 64/3,907 (1.6%) of TRULICITY-treated patients developed anti-dulaglutide antibodies (referred to as anti-drug-antibodies (ADA)). Of the 64 TRULICITY-treated patients that developed ADA, 34 patients (0.9% of the overall population) developed dulaglutide-neutralizing antibodies, and 36 patients (0.9% of the overall population) developed antibodies against native GLP-1. There was no identified clinically significant effect of ADA on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, or effectiveness of TRULICITY over the 24 to 104 week treatment duration in the trials in adults with type2 diabetes mellitus.</p><p>During the 26-week controlled period of the glycemic control trial in pediatric patients 10 years of age or older with type2 diabetes mellitus [see Clinical Studies (14.6)], 4/101 (4%) of TRULICITY-treated pediatric patients developed ADA. Of the 4 pediatric patients that developed ADA, 1 patient (1% of the overall population) developed dulaglutide-neutralizing antibodies and 3 patients (3% of the overall population) developed antibodies against native GLP-1. During the 52-week postbaseline period of the same trial (through safety follow-up), 6/103 (6%) of TRULICITY-treated patients developed ADA. Of the 6 patients that developed ADA, 1 patient (1% of the overall population) developed dulaglutide-neutralizing antibodies and 4 patients (4% of the overall population) developed antibodies against native GLP-1. Because of the low occurrence of ADA, the effect of these antibodies on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and/or effectiveness of TRULICITY is unknown in pediatric patients.</p>",

There are clinical considerations regarding the risks of poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations]. Based on animal reproduction studies, there may be risks to the fetus from exposure to dulaglutide during pregnancy. TRULICITY should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p><p>In pregnant rats administered dulaglutide during organogenesis, early embryonic deaths, fetal growth reductions, and fetal abnormalities occurred at systemic exposures at least 6-times human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 4.5mg/week. In pregnant rabbits administered dulaglutide during organogenesis, major fetal abnormalities occurred at 5-times human exposure at the MRHD. Adverse embryo/fetal effects in animals occurred in association with decreased maternal weight and food consumption attributed to the pharmacology of dulaglutide [see Data].</p><p>The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 610% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with an HbA1c &gt;7% and has been reported to be as high as 2025% in women with an HbA1c &gt;10%. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.

Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia-related morbidity.</p><p>Data</p><p>Animal Data</p><p>Pregnant rats given subcutaneous doses of 0.49, 1.63, or 4.89mg/kg dulaglutide every 3 days during organogenesis had systemic exposures 2-, 6-, and 18-times human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 4.5mg/week, respectively, based on plasma area under the time-concentration curve (AUC) comparison. Reduced fetal weights associated with decreased maternal food intake and decreased weight gain attributed to the pharmacology of dulaglutide were observed at 1.63mg/kg. Irregular skeletal ossifications and increases in post-implantation loss also were observed at 4.89mg/kg.</p><p>In pregnant rabbits given subcutaneous doses of 0.04, 0.12, or 0.41mg/kg dulaglutide every 3 days during organogenesis, systemic exposures in pregnant rabbits were 0.5-, 2-, and 5-times human exposure at the MRHD, based on plasma AUC comparison. Fetal visceral malformation of lung lobular agenesis and skeletal malformations of the vertebrae and/or ribs were observed in conjunction with decreased maternal food intake and decreased weight gain attributed to the pharmacology of dulaglutide at 0.41mg/kg.</p><p>In a prenatal-postnatal study in F0 maternal rats given subcutaneous doses of 0.2, 0.49, or 1.63mg/kg every third day from implantation through lactation, systemic exposures in pregnant rats were 1-, 2-, and 7-times human exposure at the MRHD, based on plasma AUC comparison. F1 pups from F0 maternal rats given 1.63mg/kg dulaglutide had statistically significantly lower mean body weight from birth through postnatal day 63 for males and postnatal day 84 for females. F1 offspring from F0 maternal rats receiving 1.63mg/kg dulaglutide had decreased forelimb and hindlimb grip strength and males had delayed balano-preputial separation. Females had decreased startle response. These physical findings may relate to the decreased size of the offspring relative to controls as they appeared at early postnatal assessments but were not observed at a later assessment. F1 female offspring of the F0 maternal rats given 1.63mg/kg of dulaglutide had a longer mean escape time and a higher mean number of errors relative to concurrent control during 1 of 2 trials in the memory evaluation portion of the Biel water maze. These findings occurred in conjunction with decreased F0 maternal food intake and decreased weight gain attributed to the pharmacologic activity at 1.63mg/kg.

In the 52-week trial in patients with type2 diabetes and moderate to severe renal impairment, the PK behavior of TRULICITY 0.75mg and 1.5mg once weekly was similar to that demonstrated in previous clinical studies [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</p><p>No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with renal impairment including end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Monitor renal function in patients with renal impairment reporting severe adverse gastrointestinal reactions. Use TRULICITY with caution in patients with ESRD [see Warning and Precautions (5.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</p><h2>8.7 Hepatic Impairment</h2><p>In a clinical pharmacology study in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment, no clinically relevant change in dulaglutide PK was observed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. However, there is limited clinical experience in patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment; therefore, use TRULICITY with caution in these patient populations.</p><h2>8.8 Gastroparesis</h2><p>Dulaglutide slows gastric emptying. TRULICITY has not been studied in patients with preexisting gastroparesis. Use TRULICITY with caution in patients with gastroparesis.</p>",
      "description": "<p>Dulaglutide is a human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. It is a fusion protein with two identical, disulfide-linked chains, each containing an N-terminal GLP-1 analog sequence linked to the Fc portion of a modified human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) heavy chain. It is produced using mammalian cell culture and has a molecular weight of approximately 63 kilodaltons. TRULICITY (dulaglutide) injection is a clear, colorless, sterile, preservative-free solution for subcutaneous use. Each single-dose pen contains a 0.5 mL solution of 0.75 mg, 1.5 mg, 3 mg, or 4.5 mg of dulaglutide with excipients: citric acid anhydrous, mannitol, polysorbate 80, and trisodium citrate dihydrate, in water for injection.</p>",
      "nonclinicalToxicology": "<h1>13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY</h1><h2>13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility</h2><p>A 2-year carcinogenicity study was conducted with dulaglutide in male and female rats at doses of 0.05, 0.5, 1.5, and 5mg/kg (0.2-, 3-, 8-, and 24-fold the MRHD of 4.5mg once weekly based on AUC) administered by subcutaneous injection twice weekly. In rats, dulaglutide caused a dose-related and treatment-duration-dependent increase in the incidence of thyroid C-cell tumors (adenomas and/or carcinomas) compared to controls, at 3-fold the MRHD based on AUC. A statistically significant increase in C-cell adenomas was observed in rats receiving dulaglutide at 0.5mg/kg. Numerical increases in thyroid C-cell carcinomas occurred at 5mg/kg (24 times the MRHD based on AUC) and were considered to be treatment-related despite the absence of statistical significance.</p><p>A 6-month carcinogenicity study was conducted with dulaglutide in rasH2 transgenic mice at doses of 0.3, 1, and 3mg/kg administered by subcutaneous injection twice weekly. Dulaglutide did not produce increased incidences of thyroid C-cell hyperplasia or neoplasia at any dose.</p><p>Dulaglutide is a recombinant protein; no genotoxicity studies have been conducted.</p><p>Human relevance of thyroid C-cell tumors in rats is unknown and could not be determined by clinical studies or nonclinical studies [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].</p><p>In fertility and early embryonic development studies in male and female rats, no adverse effects of dulaglutide on sperm morphology, mating, fertility, conception, and embryonic survival were observed at up to 16.3mg/kg (55-fold the MRHD based on AUC). In female rats, an increase in the number of females with prolonged diestrus and a dose-related decrease in the mean number of corpora lutea, implantation sites, and viable embryos were observed at 4.9mg/kg (13-fold the MRHD based on AUC), which occurred in the presence of decreased maternal food consumption and body weight gain.</p><h2>13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h2><p>Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats were given 0.5, 1.5, or 5mg/kg/twice weekly of dulaglutide (1-, 3-, and 13-fold the MRHD based on AUC) for 3 months. Increases of 12% to 33% in total and pancreatic amylase, but not lipase, were observed at all doses without microscopic pancreatic inflammatory correlates in individual animals. Other changes in the dulaglutide-treated animals included increased interlobular ductal epithelium without active ductal cell proliferation (0.5mg/kg), increased acinar atrophy with/without inflammation (1.5mg/kg), and increased neutrophilic inflammation of the acinar pancreas (5mg/kg).</p><p>Treatment of monkeys for 12 months with 8.15mg/kg/twice weekly of dulaglutide (nearly 200-fold the MRHD based on AUC) demonstrated no evidence of pancreatic inflammation or pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia. In 4 of 19 monkeys on dulaglutide treatment, there was an increase in goblet cells within the pancreatic ducts, but no differences from the control group in total amylase or lipase at study termination. There were no proliferative changes in the thyroid C-cells.</p>",

      "mechanismOfAction": "<h2>12.1 Mechanism of Action</h2><p>TRULICITY contains dulaglutide, which is a human GLP-1 receptor agonist with 90% amino acid sequence homology to endogenous human GLP-1 (7-37). Dulaglutide activates the GLP-1 receptor, a membrane-bound cell-surface receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase in pancreatic beta cells. Dulaglutide increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) in beta cells leading to glucose-dependent insulin release. Dulaglutide also decreases glucagon secretion and slows gastric emptying.</p>",

      "warningsAndPrecautions": "\n<h3>5.1 Diarrhea</h3>\n<p>Severe diarrhea associated with dehydration and infection occurred in patients treated with VERZENIO. Across four clinical trials in 3691 patients, diarrhea occurred in 81% to 90% of patients who received VERZENIO. Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 8% to 20% of patients receiving VERZENIO [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Most patients experienced diarrhea during the first month of VERZENIO treatment. The median time to onset of the first diarrhea event ranged from 6 to 8 days; and the median duration of Grade 2 and Grade 3 diarrhea ranged from 6 to 11 days and 5 to 8 days, respectively. Across trials, 19% to 26% of patients with diarrhea required a VERZENIO dose interruption and 13% to 23% required a dose reduction. Instruct patients to start antidiarrheal therapy such as loperamide at the first sign of loose stools, increase oral fluids, and notify their healthcare provider for further instructions and appropriate follow up [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, or diarrhea that requires hospitalization, discontinue VERZENIO until toxicity resolves to Grade 1, and then resume VERZENIO at the next lower dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].</p>\n<h3>5.2 Neutropenia</h3>\n<p>Neutropenia, including febrile neutropenia and fatal neutropenic sepsis, occurred in patients treated with VERZENIO. Across four clinical trials in 3691 patients, neutropenia occurred in 37% to 46% of patients receiving VERZENIO. A Grade 3 decrease in neutrophil count (based on laboratory findings) occurred in 19% to 32% of patients receiving VERZENIO. Across trials, the median time to the first episode of Grade 3 neutropenia ranged from 29 days to 33 days, and the median duration of Grade 3 neutropenia ranged from 11 days to 16 days [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Febrile neutropenia has been reported in less than 1% of patients exposed to VERZENIO across trials. Two deaths due to neutropenic sepsis were observed in MONARCH 2. Inform patients to promptly report any episodes of fever to their healthcare provider [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Monitor complete blood counts prior to the start of VERZENIO therapy, every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, monthly for the next 2 months, and as clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose reduction, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].</p>\n<h3>5.3 Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) or Pneumonitis</h3>\n<p>Severe, life-threatening, or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pneumonitis can occur in patients treated with VERZENIO and other CDK4/6 inhibitors. In VERZENIO-treated patients in early breast cancer (monarchE, N=2791), 3% of patients experienced ILD or pneumonitis of any grade: 0.4% were Grade 3 or 4 and there was one fatality (0.1%). In VERZENIO-treated patients in advanced or metastatic breast cancer (N=900) (MONARCH 1, MONARCH 2, MONARCH 3), 3.3% of VERZENIO-treated patients had ILD or pneumonitis of any grade: 0.6% had Grade 3 or 4, and 0.4% had fatal outcomes. Additional cases of ILD or pneumonitis have been observed in the postmarketing setting, with fatalities reported [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD or pneumonitis. Symptoms may include hypoxia, cough, dyspnea, or interstitial infiltrates on radiologic exams. Infectious, neoplastic, and other causes for such symptoms should be excluded by means of appropriate investigations. Dose interruption or dose reduction is recommended for patients who develop persistent or recurrent Grade 2 ILD or pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue VERZENIO in all patients with Grade 3 or 4 ILD or pneumonitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].</p>\n<h3>5.4 Hepatotoxicity</h3>\n<p>Grade 3 ALT (2% to 6%) and AST (2% to 3%) were reported in patients receiving VERZENIO. Across three clinical trials in 3559 patients (monarchE, MONARCH 2, MONARCH 3), the median time to onset of Grade 3 ALT increases ranged from 57 to 87 days and the median time to resolution to Grade less than 3 was 13 to 14 days. The median time to onset of Grade 3 AST increases ranged from 71 to 185 days and the median time to resolution to Grade less than 3 ranged from 11 to 15 days. Monitor liver function tests (LFTs) prior to the start of VERZENIO therapy, every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, monthly for the next 2 months, and as clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose reduction, dose discontinuation, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop persistent or recurrent Grade 2, or any Grade 3 or Grade 4 hepatic transaminase elevation [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].</p>\n<h3>5.5 Venous Thromboembolism</h3>\n<p>Across three clinical trials in 3559 patients (monarchE, MONARCH 2, MONARCH 3), venous thromboembolic events were reported in 2% to 5% of patients treated with VERZENIO. Venous thromboembolic events included deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, pelvic venous thrombosis, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, subclavian and axillary vein thrombosis, and inferior vena cava thrombosis. In clinical trials, deaths due to venous thromboembolism have been reported in patients treated with VERZENIO. VERZENIO has not been studied in patients with early breast cancer who had a history of venous thromboembolism. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and treat as medically appropriate. Dose interruption is recommended for early breast cancer patients with any grade venous thromboembolic event and for advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients with a Grade 3 or 4 venous thromboembolic event [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].</p>\n<h3>5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity</h3>\n<p>Based on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action, VERZENIO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of abemaciclib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused teratogenicity and decreased fetal weight at maternal exposures that were similar to the human clinical exposure based on area under the curve (AUC) at the maximum recommended human dose. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with VERZENIO and for 3 weeks after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)].</p>",

      "clinicalPharmacology": "<h1>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1><h2>12.1 Mechanism of Action</h2><p>Abemaciclib is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4 and CDK6). These kinases are activated upon binding to D-cyclins. In estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer cell lines, cyclin D1 and CDK4/6 promote phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation. In vitro, continuous exposure to abemaciclib inhibited Rb phosphorylation and blocked progression from G1 into S phase of the cell cycle, resulting in senescence and apoptosis. In breast cancer xenograft models, abemaciclib dosed daily without interruption as a single agent or in combination with antiestrogens resulted in reduction of tumor size.</p><h2>12.2 Pharmacodynamics</h2><p>Cardiac Electrophysiology</p><p>Based on evaluation of the QTc interval in patients and in a healthy volunteer study, abemaciclib did not cause large mean increases (i.e., 20ms) in the QTc interval.</p><h2>12.3 Pharmacokinetics</h2><p>The pharmacokinetics of abemaciclib were characterized in patients with solid tumors, including breast cancer, and in healthy subjects.</p><p>Following single and repeated twice daily dosing of 50mg (0.3 times the approved recommended 150mg dosage) to 200mg of abemaciclib, the increase in plasma exposure (AUC) and Cmax was approximately dose proportional.

The effect of severe renal impairment (CLcr &lt;30mL/min) on pharmacokinetics of abemaciclib is unknown.</p><p>Patients with Hepatic Impairment</p><p>Following a single 200mg oral dose of abemaciclib, the relative potency adjusted unbound AUC0-INF of abemaciclib plus its active metabolites (M2, M18, M20) in plasma increased 1.2-fold in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A, n=9), 1.1-fold in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B, n=10), and 2.4-fold in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C, n=6) relative to subjects with normal hepatic function (n=10) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. In subjects with severe hepatic impairment, the mean plasma elimination half-life of abemaciclib increased to 55 hours compared to 24 hours in subjects with normal hepatic function.</p><p>Drug Interaction Studies</p><p>Effects of Other Drugs on Abemaciclib</p><p>Strong CYP3A Inhibitors: Ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A inhibitor) is predicted to increase the AUC of abemaciclib by up to 16-fold.</p><p>Coadministration of 500mg twice daily doses of clarithromycin (a strong CYP3A inhibitor) with a single 50mg dose of VERZENIO (0.3 times the approved recommended 150mg dosage) increased the relative potency adjusted unbound AUC0-INF of abemaciclib plus its active metabolites (M2, M18, and M20) by 2.5-fold relative to abemaciclib alone in cancer patients.</p><p>Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors: Verapamil and diltiazem (moderate CYP3A inhibitors) are predicted to increase the relative potency adjusted unbound AUC of abemaciclib plus its active metabolites (M2, M18, and M20) by approximately 1.6-fold and 2.4-fold, respectively.</p><p>Strong CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration of 600mg daily doses of rifampin (a strong CYP3A inducer) with a single 200mg dose of VERZENIO decreased the relative potency adjusted unbound AUC0-INF of abemaciclib plus its active metabolites (M2, M18, and M20) by approximately 70% in healthy subjects.</p><p>Moderate CYP3A Inducers: Efavirenz, bosentan, and modafinil (moderate CYP3A inducers) are predicted to decrease the relative potency adjusted unbound AUC of abemaciclib plus its active metabolites (M2, M18, and M20) by 53%, 41%, and 29%, respectively.</p><p>Loperamide: Co-administration of a single 8mg dose of loperamide with a single 400mg dose of abemaciclib in healthy subjects increased the relative potency adjusted unbound AUC0-INF of abemaciclib plus its active metabolites (M2 and M20) by 12%, which is not considered clinically relevant.</p><p>Endocrine Therapies: In clinical studies in patients with breast cancer, there was no clinically relevant effect of fulvestrant, anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane, or tamoxifen on abemaciclib pharmacokinetics.</p><p>Effects of Abemaciclib on Other Drugs</p><p>Loperamide: In a clinical drug interaction study in healthy subjects, coadministration of a single 8mg dose of loperamide with a single 400mg abemaciclib (2.7 times the approved recommended 150mg dosage) increased loperamide AUC0-INF by 9% and Cmax by 35% relative to loperamide alone. These increases in loperamide exposure are not considered clinically relevant.</p><p>Metformin: In a clinical drug interaction study in healthy subjects, coadministration of a single 1000mg dose of metformin, a clinically relevant substrate of renal OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2-K transporters, with a single 400mg dose of abemaciclib (2.7 times the approved recommended 150mg dosage) increased metformin AUC0-INF by 37% and Cmax by 22% relative to metformin alone. Abemaciclib reduced the renal clearance and renal secretion of metformin by 45% and 62%, respectively, relative to metformin alone, without any effect on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as measured by iohexol clearance and serum cystatin C.</p><p>Endocrine Therapies: In clinical studies in patients with breast cancer, there was no clinically relevant effect of abemaciclib on the pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant, anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane, or tamoxifen.</p><p>CYP Metabolic Pathways: In a clinical drug interaction study in patients with cancer, multiple doses of abemaciclib (200mg twice daily for 7 days) did not result in clinically meaningful changes in the pharmacokinetics of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 substrates. Abemaciclib is a substrate of CYP3A4, and time-dependent changes in pharmacokinetics of abemaciclib as a result of autoinhibition of its metabolism were not observed.</p><p>In Vitro Studies</p><p>Transporter Systems: Abemaciclib and its major active metabolites inhibit the renal transporters OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2-K at concentrations achievable at the approved recommended dosage. The observed serum creatinine increase in clinical studies with abemaciclib is likely due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine via OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2-K [see Adverse Effects (6.1)]. Abemaciclib and its major metabolites at clinically relevant concentrations do not inhibit the hepatic uptake transporters OCT1, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3 or the renal uptake transporters OAT1 and OAT3.</p><p>Abemaciclib is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP. Abemaciclib and its major active metabolites, M2 and M20, are not substrates of hepatic uptake transporters OCT1, organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), or OATP1B3.</p><p>Abemaciclib inhibits P-gp and BCRP. The clinical consequences of this finding on sensitive P-gp and BCRP substrates are unknown.</p><p>P-gp and BCRP Inhibitors: In vitro, abemaciclib is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP. The effect of P-gp or BCRP inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of abemaciclib has not been studied.</p>",

In a rat male fertility study, abemaciclib had no effects on mating and fertility at oral doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 2 times the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose based on AUC).</p><p>In a rat female fertility and early embryonic development study, abemaciclib did not affect mating and fertility at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 times the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose based on AUC).</p><h2>13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology</h2><p>In repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 6-months duration, oral administration of abemaciclib resulted in retinal atrophy of the eyes in mice at a dose of 150 mg/kg/day (approximately 10 times the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose based on AUC) and in rats at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 5 times the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose based on AUC). In a 2-year rat carcinogenicity study, oral administration of abemaciclib resulted in retinal atrophy in the eyes at doses 0.3 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.05 times the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose based on AUC).</p>",
      "mechanismOfAction": "<h2>12.1 Mechanism of Action</h2><p>Abemaciclib is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4 and CDK6). These kinases are activated upon binding to D-cyclins. In estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer cell lines, cyclin D1 and CDK4/6 promote phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation. In vitro, continuous exposure to abemaciclib inhibited Rb phosphorylation and blocked progression from G1 into S phase of the cell cycle, resulting in senescence and apoptosis. In breast cancer xenograft models, abemaciclib dosed daily without interruption as a single agent or in combination with antiestrogens resulted in reduction of tumor size.</p>",
