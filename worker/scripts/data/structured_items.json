However, maintenance of pregnancy was adversely affected at these doses based upon findings of increased post-implantation losses (early resorptions) and decreased numbers of mean viable embryos per litter. The number of viable embryos was unaffected in female rats that received baricitinib at an oral dose of 5mg/kg/day and were mated to males that received the same dose (approximately 6 times the MRHD on an AUC basis).

No effects of tirzepatide were observed on sperm morphology, mating, fertility, and conception. In female rats, an increase in the number of females with prolonged diestrus and a decrease in the mean number of corpora lutea resulting in a decrease in the mean number of implantation sites and viable embryos was observed at all dose levels. These effects were considered secondary to the pharmacological effects of tirzepatide on food consumption and body weight."

In animal reproduction studies, administration of pirtobrutinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused embryo-fetal toxicity including embryo-fetal mortality and malformations at maternal exposures (AUC) approximately 3-times the recommended dose of 200 mg once daily. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with JAYPIRCA and for one week after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)]."

Efficacy was based on 108 patients with CLL/SLL treated with JAYPIRCA who were previously treated with at least two prior lines of therapy, including a BTK inhibitor and a BCL-2 inhibitor. JAYPIRCA was given orally at a dose of 200 mg once daily and was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The trial required a platelet count 50 x 109/L, absolute neutrophil count 0.75 x 109/L, hepatic transaminases 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN), and an ECOG performance status of 0 to 2. The trial excluded patients with significant cardiovascular disease, major bleeding, uncontrolled or symptomatic arrhythmias, prolonged QTc interval, or need for a strong CYP3A inhibitor or inducer or strong P-gp inhibitor. Patients with active central nervous system (CNS) involvement by lymphoma or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) within 60 days were excluded."

Among those patients with central testing available, 42% (37 of 88 patients) had a C481 BTK mutation, 54% (43 of 79 patients) had 17p deletion and/or TP53 mutation, 93% (77 of 83 patients) had unmutated IGHV, and 22% (16 of 72 patients) had 11q deletion. Patients received a median number of 5 prior lines of therapy (range: 2 to 11). The most common prior BTK inhibitors received were ibrutinib (97%), acalabrutinib (9%), and zanubrutinib (0.9%).

Lebrikizumab-lbkz inhibits IL-13-induced responses including the release of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and IgE.

Exenatide treatment group assignment was open-label while the treatment assignments to placebo, TRULICITY 0.75mg, and TRULICITY 1.5mg were blinded. After 26 weeks, patients in the placebo treatment group were randomized to either TRULICITY 0.75mg once weekly or TRULICITY 1.5mg once weekly to maintain blinding. Randomization occurred after a 12-week lead-in period; during the initial 4 weeks of the lead-in period, patients were titrated to maximally tolerated doses of metformin and pioglitazone; this was followed by an 8-week glycemic stabilization period prior to randomization. Patients randomized to exenatide started at a dose of 5mcg BID for 4 weeks and then were escalated to 10mcg BID. Patients had a mean age of 56 years; mean duration of type2 diabetes of 9 years; 58% were male; race: White, Black and Asian were 74%, 8% and 3%, respectively; and 81% of the trial population were in the US."

These physical findings may relate to the decreased size of the offspring relative to controls as they appeared at early postnatal assessments but were not observed at a later assessment. F1 female offspring of the F0 maternal rats given 1.63mg/kg of dulaglutide had a longer mean escape time and a higher mean number of errors relative to concurrent control during 1 of 2 trials in the memory evaluation portion of the Biel water maze.

                "MONARCH 2 (NCT02107703) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter study in women with HR-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer in combination with fulvestrant in patients with disease progression following endocrine therapy who had not received chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. Randomization was stratified by disease site (visceral, bone only, or other) and by sensitivity to prior endocrine therapy (primary or secondary resistance). Primary endocrine therapy resistance was defined as relapse while on the first 2 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy or progressive disease within the first 6 months of first line endocrine therapy for metastatic breast cancer. A total of 669 patients were randomized to receive VERZENIO or placebo orally twice daily plus intramuscular injection of 500mg fulvestrant on days 1 and 15 of cycle 1 and then on day 1 of cycle 2 and beyond (28-day cycles). Pre/perimenopausal women were enrolled in the study and received the gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist goserelin for at least 4weeks prior to and for the duration of MONARCH 2. Patients remained on continuous treatment until development of progressive disease or unmanageable toxicity."

In vitro, continuous exposure to abemaciclib inhibited Rb phosphorylation and blocked progression from G1 into S phase of the cell cycle, resulting in senescence and apoptosis. In breast cancer xenograft models, abemaciclib dosed daily without interruption as a single agent or in combination with antiestrogens resulted in reduction of tumor size."
