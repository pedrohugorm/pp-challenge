      "warningsAndPrecautions": "\n<h3>5.1 Serious Infections</h3>\n<p>Serious and sometimes fatal infections due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, viral, or other opportunistic pathogens have been reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving OLUMIANT. The most common serious infections reported with OLUMIANT included pneumonia, herpes zoster, and urinary tract infection [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Among opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, multidermatomal herpes zoster, esophageal candidiasis, pneumocystosis, acute histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, cytomegalovirus, and BK virus were reported with OLUMIANT. Some patients have presented with disseminated rather than localized disease, and were often taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as methotrexate or corticosteroids.</p>\n<p>Avoid use of OLUMIANT in patients with an active, serious infection, including localized infections. Consider the risks and benefits of treatment prior to initiating OLUMIANT in patients:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>with chronic or recurrent infection</li>\n<li>who have been exposed to tuberculosis</li>\n<li>with a history of a serious or an opportunistic infection</li>\n<li>who have resided or traveled in areas of endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or</li>\n<li>with underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In patients with rheumatoid arthritis or alopecia areata, closely monitor for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with OLUMIANT. Interrupt OLUMIANT in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or alopecia areata, if the patient develops a serious infection, an opportunistic infection, or sepsis. A patient who develops a new infection during treatment with OLUMIANT should undergo prompt and complete diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised patient; appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be initiated, the patient should be closely monitored, and OLUMIANT should be interrupted if the patient is not responding to therapy. Do not resume OLUMIANT until the infection is controlled.</p>\n<p>In patients with COVID-19, monitor for signs and symptoms of new infections during and after treatment with OLUMIANT. There is limited information regarding the use of OLUMIANT in patients with COVID-19 and concomitant active serious infections. The risks and benefits of treatment with OLUMIANT in COVID-19 patients with other concurrent infections should be considered.</p>\n<p>Tuberculosis</p>\n<p>Evaluate patients for active infection prior to administration of OLUMIANT. OLUMIANT should not be given to patients with active TB.</p>\n<p>Test patients with rheumatoid arthritis or alopecia areata for latent tuberculosis. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis or alopecia areata and latent tuberculosis (TB) should be treated with standard antimycobacterial therapy before initiating OLUMIANT. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiation of OLUMIANT in patients with a history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed, and for patients with a negative test for latent TB but who have risk factors for TB infection. Consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of TB is recommended to aid in the decision about whether initiating anti-TB therapy is appropriate for an individual patient.</p>\n<p>During OLUMIANT use, monitor patients for the development of signs and symptoms of TB, including patients who tested negative for latent TB infection prior to initiating therapy.</p>\n<p>Viral Reactivation</p>\n<p>Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation (e.g., herpes zoster), were reported in clinical studies with OLUMIANT. If a patient develops herpes zoster, interrupt OLUMIANT treatment until the episode resolves.</p>\n<p>The impact of OLUMIANT on chronic viral hepatitis reactivation is unknown. Patients with evidence of active hepatitis B or C infection were excluded from clinical trials. In clinical trials in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or alopecia areata, patients who were positive for hepatitis C antibody but negative for hepatitis C virus RNA were permitted to enroll. Patients with positive hepatitis B surface antibody and hepatitis B core antibody, without hepatitis B surface antigen, were permitted to enroll; such patients should be monitored for expression of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA. Should HBV DNA be detected, consult with a hepatologist. Perform screening for viral hepatitis in accordance with clinical guidelines before starting therapy with OLUMIANT.</p>\n<h3>5.2 Mortality</h3>\n<p>In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study of another JAK inhibitor in RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, a higher rate of all-cause mortality, including sudden cardiovascular death, was observed in patients treated with the JAK inhibitor compared with TNF blockers. Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with OLUMIANT.</p>\n<h3>5.3 Malignancy and Lymphoproliferative Disorders</h3>\n<p>Malignancies were observed in clinical studies of OLUMIANT [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</p>\n<p>In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study of another JAK inhibitor in RA patients, a higher rate of malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC)) was observed in patients treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. A higher rate of lymphomas was observed in patients treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. A higher rate of lung cancers was observed in current or past smokers treated with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. In this study, current or past smokers had an additional increased risk of overall malignancies.</p>\n<p>Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with OLUMIANT, particularly in patients with a known malignancy (other than successfully treated NMSC), patients who develop a malignancy, and patients who are current or past smokers.</p>\n<p>Non-melanoma skin cancers</p>\n<p>Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) have been reported in patients treated with OLUMIANT. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.</p>\n<h3>5.4 Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events</h3>\n<p>In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study of another JAK inhibitor in RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, a higher rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and non-fatal stroke was observed with the JAK inhibitor compared to those treated with TNF blockers. Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk.</p>\n<p>Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with OLUMIANT, particularly in patients who are current or past smokers and patients with other cardiovascular risk factors. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious cardiovascular events and the steps to take if they occur. Discontinue OLUMIANT in patients that have experienced a myocardial infarction or stroke.</p>\n<h3>5.5 Thrombosis</h3>\n<p>Thrombosis, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), has been observed at an increased incidence in patients treated with OLUMIANT compared to placebo. In addition, arterial thrombosis events in the extremities have been reported in clinical studies with OLUMIANT. Many of these adverse events were serious and some resulted in death. There was no clear relationship between platelet count elevations and thrombotic events. In a large, randomized, postmarketing safety study of another JAK inhibitor in RA patients 50 years of age and older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, higher rates of overall thrombosis, DVT, and PE were observed compared to those treated with TNF blockers.</p>\n<p>If clinical features of DVT/PE or arterial thrombosis occur, patients should discontinue OLUMIANT and be evaluated promptly and treated appropriately. Avoid OLUMIANT in patients that may be at increased risk of thrombosis.</p>\n<h3>5.6 Hypersensitivity</h3>\n<p>Reactions such as angioedema, urticaria, and rash that may reflect drug hypersensitivity have been observed in patients receiving OLUMIANT, including serious reactions. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, promptly discontinue OLUMIANT while evaluating the potential causes of the reaction [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].</p>\n<h3>5.7 Gastrointestinal Perforations</h3>\n<p>Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported in clinical studies with OLUMIANT.</p>\n<p>Monitor OLUMIANT-treated patients who may be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients with a history of diverticulitis). Evaluate promptly patients presenting with new onset abdominal symptoms for early identification of gastrointestinal perforation.</p>\n<h3>5.8 Laboratory Abnormalities</h3>\n<p>Neutropenia Treatment with OLUMIANT was associated with an increased incidence of neutropenia (ANC less than 1000cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) compared to placebo.</p>\n<p>In patients with rheumatoid arthritis or alopecia areata, avoid initiation or interrupt OLUMIANT treatment in patients with an ANC less than 1000cells/mm<sup>3</sup>.</p>\n<p>In patients with COVID-19, there is limited information regarding use of OLUMIANT in patients with ANC less than 1000cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. Avoid initiation or interrupt OLUMIANT treatment in patients with COVID-19 and an ANC less than 500cells/mm<sup>3</sup>.</p>\n<p>Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Adjust dosing based on ANC [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.5) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</p>\n<p>Lymphopenia ALC less than 500cells/mm<sup>3</sup> were reported in OLUMIANT clinical trials. Lymphocyte counts less than the lower limit of normal were associated with infection in patients treated with OLUMIANT, but not placebo.</p>\n<p>In patients with rheumatoid arthritis or alopecia areata, avoid initiation or interrupt OLUMIANT treatment in patients with an ALC less than 500cells/mm<sup>3</sup>.</p>\n<p>In patients with COVID-19, there is limited information regarding use of OLUMIANT in patients with ALC less than 200cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. Avoid initiation or interrupt OLUMIANT treatment in patients with COVID-19 and an ALC less than 200cells/mm<sup>3</sup>.</p>\n<p>Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Adjust dosing based on ALC [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.5)].</p>\n<p>Anemia Decreases in hemoglobin levels to less than 8g/dL were reported in OLUMIANT clinical trials. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis or alopecia areata, avoid initiation or interrupt OLUMIANT treatment in patients with hemoglobin less than 8g/dL. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Adjust dosing based on hemoglobin levels [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.5)].</p>\n<p>In patients with COVID-19, there is limited information regarding use of OLUMIANT in patients with hemoglobin less than 8g/dL.</p>\n<p>Liver Enzyme Elevations Treatment with OLUMIANT was associated with increased incidence of liver enzyme elevation compared to placebo. Increases of ALT 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and increases of AST 10 times the ULN were observed in patients in OLUMIANT clinical trials. Evaluate at baseline and thereafter according to routine patient management. Prompt investigation of the cause of liver enzyme elevation is recommended to identify potential cases of drug-induced liver injury. If increases in ALT or AST are observed and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, interrupt OLUMIANT until this diagnosis is excluded [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].</p>\n<p>Lipid Elevations Treatment with OLUMIANT was associated with increases in lipid parameters, including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Assessment of lipid parameters should be performed approximately 12weeks following OLUMIANT initiation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or alopecia areata [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Manage patients according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia.</p>\n<h3>5.9 Vaccinations</h3>\n<p>Avoid use of live vaccines with OLUMIANT. Update immunizations in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or alopecia areata prior to initiating OLUMIANT therapy in agreement with current immunization guidelines.</p>",

      "drugInteractions": "<h1>7 DRUG INTERACTIONS</h1><h2>7.1 Strong OAT3 Inhibitors</h2><p>Baricitinib exposure is increased when OLUMIANT is co-administered with strong OAT3 inhibitors (such as probenecid), hence the dosage of baricitinib should be reduced by half the recommended dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</p><h2>7.2 Other JAK Inhibitors or Biologic DMARDs</h2><p>OLUMIANT has not been studied in combination with other JAK inhibitors or with biologic DMARDs [see Indications and Usage (1.1, 1.2)].</p>",
      "clinicalPharmacology": "<h1>12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1><h2>12.1 Mechanism of Action</h2><p>Baricitinib is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. JAKs are intracellular enzymes which transmit signals arising from cytokine or growth factor-receptor interactions on the cellular membrane to influence cellular processes of hematopoiesis and immune cell function. Within the signaling pathway, JAKs phosphorylate and activate Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs) which modulate intracellular activity including gene expression. Baricitinib modulates the signaling pathway at the point of JAKs, preventing the phosphorylation and activation of STATs.</p><p>JAK enzymes transmit cytokine signaling through their pairing (e.g., JAK1/JAK2, JAK1/JAK3, JAK1/TYK2, JAK2/JAK2, JAK2/TYK2). In cell-free isolated enzyme assays, baricitinib had greater inhibitory potency at JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 relative to JAK3. In human leukocytes, baricitinib inhibited cytokine induced STAT phosphorylation mediated by JAK1/JAK2, JAK1/JAK3, JAK1/TYK2, or JAK2/TYK2 with comparable potencies. However, the relevance of inhibition of specific JAK enzymes to therapeutic effectiveness is not currently known.</p><h2>12.2 Pharmacodynamics</h2><p>Baricitinib inhibition of IL-6 induced STAT3 phosphorylation Baricitinib administration resulted in a dose dependent inhibition of IL-6 induced STAT3 phosphorylation in whole blood from healthy subjects with maximal inhibition observed approximately 1hour after dosing, which returned to near baseline by 24hours. Similar levels of inhibition were observed using either IL-6 or TPO as the stimulus.</p><p>Immunoglobulins Mean serum IgG, IgM, and IgA values decreased by 12weeks after starting treatment with OLUMIANT, and remained stable through at least 52weeks. For most patients, changes in immunoglobulins occurred within the normal reference range.</p><p>C-reactive protein In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, decreases in serum C-reactive protein (CRP) were observed as early as one week after starting treatment with OLUMIANT and were maintained throughout dosing.</p><p>Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 10 times the maximum recommended dose, baricitinib does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent.</p><h2>12.3 Pharmacokinetics</h2><p>Following oral administration of OLUMIANT, peak plasma concentrations are reached approximately at 1hour. A dose-proportional increase in systemic exposure was observed in the therapeutic dose range. The pharmacokinetics of baricitinib do not change over time. Steady-state concentrations are achieved in 2 to 3days with minimal accumulation after once-daily administration.</p><p>Absorption The absolute bioavailability of baricitinib is approximately 80%. An assessment of food effects in healthy subjects showed that a high-fat meal decreased the mean AUC and Cmax of baricitinib by approximately 11% and 18%, respectively, and delayed the tmax by 0.5hours. Administration with meals is not associated with a clinically relevant effect on exposure. In clinical studies, OLUMIANT was administered without regard to meals.</p><p>Distribution After intravenous administration, the volume of distribution is 76L, indicating distribution of baricitinib into tissues. Baricitinib is approximately 50% bound to plasma proteins and 45% bound to serum proteins. Baricitinib is a substrate of the Pgp, BCRP, OAT3 and MATE2-K transporters, which play roles in drug distribution.</p><p>Elimination</p><p>Rheumatoid Arthritis and Alopecia Areata: The total body clearance of baricitinib is 8.9L/h in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 11L/h in patients with alopecia areata. Elimination half-life in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and alopecia areata is approximately 12to 16 hours.</p><p>COVID-19: The total body clearance and half-life of baricitinib is 14.2L/h and 10.8 hours, respectively, in patients with COVID-19 who are intubated and have baricitinib administered via NG or OG tube.</p><p>Metabolism Approximately 6% of the orally administered baricitinib dose is identified as metabolites (three from urine and one from feces), with CYP3A4 identified as the main metabolizing enzyme. No metabolites of baricitinib were quantifiable in plasma.</p><p>Excretion Renal elimination is the principal clearance mechanism for baricitinib through filtration and active secretion as baricitinib is identified as a substrate of OAT3, Pgp, BCRP and MATE2-K from in vitro studies. In a clinical pharmacology study, approximately 75% of the administered dose was eliminated in the urine, while about 20% of the dose was eliminated in the feces. Baricitinib was excreted predominately as unchanged drug in urine (69%) and feces (15%).</p><p>Specific Populations</p><p>Effects of Body Weight, Gender, Race, and Age</p><p>Body weight, gender, race, ethnicity, and age did not have a clinically relevant effect on the PK (AUC and Cmax) of baricitinib (Figure 1). The mean effects of intrinsic factors on PK parameters (AUC and Cmax) were generally within the inter-subject PK variability of baricitinib. The inter-subject variabilities (% coefficients of variation) in AUC and Cmax of baricitinib are approximately 41% and 22%, respectively, in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].</p><p>Patients with Renal Impairment</p><p>Baricitinib systemic exposure in AUC was increased by 1.41-, 2.22-, 4.05- and 2.41-fold for mild, moderate, severe, and ESRD (with hemodialysis) renal impairment sub-groups, respectively, compared to subjects with normal renal function. The corresponding values for increase in Cmax were 1.16-, 1.46-, 1.40- and 0.88-fold, respectively (Figure 1) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)].</p><p>Patients with Hepatic Impairment</p><p>Baricitinib systemic exposure and Cmax increased by 1.19- and 1.08-fold for the moderate hepatic impairment group, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function (Figure 1) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].</p><p>Figure 1: Impact of Intrinsic Factors on Baricitinib Pharmacokineticsa, b</p><p>a Reference values for weight, age, gender, and race comparisons are 70kg, 54years, male, and white, respectively; reference groups for renal and hepatic impairment are subjects with normal renal and hepatic function, respectively.</p><p>b Effects of renal and hepatic impairment on baricitinib exposure were summarized from dedicated renal and hepatic impairment studies, respectively. Effects of other intrinsic factors on baricitinib exposure were summarized from population PK analysis.</p><p>c The recommended dose for patients with COVID-19 and severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 - &lt;30mL/min/1.73m2) is 1 mg once daily. OLUMIANT is not recommended for use in patients with COVID-19 who are on dialysis, have end-stage renal disease (ESRD), or acute kidney injury (eGFR &lt;15mL/min/1.73m2). [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]</p><p>Drug Interactions</p><p>Potential for Baricitinib to Influence the PK of Other Drugs</p><p>In vitro, baricitinib did not significantly inhibit or induce the activity of cytochrome P450enzymes (CYPs 3A, 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6). In clinical pharmacology studies, there were no clinically meaningful changes in the pharmacokinetics (PK) of simvastatin, ethinyl estradiol, or levonorgestrel (CYP3A substrates) when co-administered with baricitinib.</p><p>In vitro studies suggest that baricitinib is not an inhibitor of the transporters, P-glycoprotein (Pgp) or Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide (OATP) 1B1. In vitro data indicate baricitinib does inhibit organic anionic transporter (OAT) 1, OAT2, OAT3, organic cationic transporter (OCT) 1, OCT2, OATP1B3, Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) and Multidrug and Toxic Extrusion Protein (MATE) 1 and MATE2-K, but clinically meaningful changes in the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are substrates for these transporters are unlikely. In clinical pharmacology studies there were no clinically meaningful effects on the PK of digoxin (Pgp substrate) or methotrexate (substrate of several transporters) when co-administered with baricitinib.</p><p>Exposure changes of drugs following co-administration with baricitinib are shown in Figure 2.</p><p>Figure 2: Impact of Baricitinib on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugsa</p><p>a Reference group is administration of concomitant drug alone.</p><p>Potential for Other Drugs to Influence the PK of Baricitinib</p><p>In vitro studies suggest that baricitinib is a CYP3A4 substrate. In clinical pharmacology studies there was no effect on the PK of baricitinib when co-administered with ketoconazole (CYP3A inhibitor). There were no clinically meaningful changes in the PK of baricitinib when co-administered with fluconazole (CYP3A/CYP2C19/CYP2C9 inhibitor) or rifampicin (CYP3A inducer).</p><p>In vitro studies suggest that baricitinib is a substrate for OAT3, Pgp, BCRP and MATE2-K. In a clinical study, probenecid administration (strong OAT3 inhibitor) resulted in an approximately 2-fold increase in baricitinib AUC0- with no effect on Cmax and tmax[see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3) and Drug Interactions (7.1)]. However, simulations with diclofenac and ibuprofen (OAT3 inhibitors with less inhibition potential) predicted minimal effect on the PK of baricitinib. In clinical pharmacology studies there was no clinically meaningful effect on the PK of baricitinib when co-administered with cyclosporine (Pgp and BCRP inhibitor). Co-administration with methotrexate (substrate of several transporters) did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the PK of baricitinib.</p><p>Exposure changes of baricitinib following co-administration with CYP inhibitors or inducers, transporter inhibitors, as well as methotrexate and the proton pump inhibitor, omeprazole, are shown in Figure 3.</p><p>Figure 3: Impact of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Baricitinibb</p><p>a Values are based on simulated studies.</p><p>b Reference group is administration of baricitinib alone.</p>",

      "useInSpecificPopulations": "<h1>8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</h1><h2>8.1 Pregnancy</h2><p>Risk Summary</p><p>Based on the findings from animal reproduction studies, OLUMIANT may cause fetal harm during pregnancy. Available data from clinical trials and postmarketing case reports with OLUMIANT exposure in pregnancy are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are no human data on chronic baricitinib exposure throughout pregnancy. There are risks to the mother and the fetus associated with rheumatoid arthritis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). Consider the risks and benefits with chronic use of OLUMIANT during pregnancy.</p><p>In animal embryo-fetal development studies, oral baricitinib administration to pregnant rats and rabbits at exposures equal to and greater than approximately 11 and 46 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 4 mg/day, respectively, resulted in reduced fetal body weights, increased embryolethality (rabbits only), and dose-related increases in skeletal malformations. No developmental toxicity was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits treated with oral baricitinib during organogenesis at approximately 2 and 7 times the exposure at the MRHD, respectively. In a pre- and post-natal development study in pregnant female rats, oral baricitinib administration at exposures approximately 24 times the MRHD resulted in reduction in pup viability (increased incidence of stillborn pups and early neonatal deaths), decreased fetal birth weight, reduced fetal body weight gain, decreased cytotoxic T cells on post-natal day (PND) 35 with evidence of recovery by PND 65, and developmental delays that might be attributable to decreased body weight gain. No developmental toxicity was observed at an exposure approximately 5times the exposure at the MRHD (see Data).</p><p>The background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.</p><p>Report pregnancies to Eli Lilly and Company at 1-800-LillyRx (1-800-545-5979).</p><p>Clinical Considerations</p><p>Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk</p><p>Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with rheumatoid arthritis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth.</p><p>Data</p><p>Animal Data</p><p>In an embryofetal development study in pregnant rats, dosed orally during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6 to 17, baricitinib was teratogenic (skeletal malformations that consisted of bent limb bones and rib anomalies) at exposures equal to or greater than approximately 11 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses of 10mg/kg/day and higher). No developmental toxicity was observed in rats at an exposure approximately 2times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 2mg/kg/day).</p><p>In an embryofetal development study in pregnant rabbits, dosed orally during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7 to 20, embryolethality, decreased fetal body weights, and skeletal malformations (rib anomalies) were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity at an exposure approximately 46times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 30mg/kg/day). Embryolethality consisted of increased post-implantation loss that was due to elevated incidences of both early and late resorptions. No developmental toxicity was observed in rabbits at an exposure approximately 7times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 10mg/kg/day).</p><p>In a pre- and post-natal development study in pregnant female rats dosed orally from gestation day 6 through lactation day 20, adverse findings observed in pups included decreased survival from birth to post-natal day 4 (due to increased stillbirths and early neonatal deaths), decreased birth weight, decreased body weight gain during the pre-weaning phase, increased incidence of malrotated forelimbs during the pre-weaning phase, and decreased cytotoxic Tcells on PND 35 with recovery by PND 65 at exposures approximately 24 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 25mg/kg/day). Developmental delays (that may be secondary to decreased body weight gain) were observed in males and females at exposures approximately 24 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 25mg/kg/day). These findings included decreased forelimb and hindlimb grip strengths, and delayed mean age of sexual maturity. No developmental toxicity was observed in rats at an exposure approximately 5times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 5mg/kg/day).</p><h2>8.2 Lactation</h2><p>Risk Summary</p><p>No information is available on the presence of OLUMIANT in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant, or the effects of the drug on milk production. Baricitinib is present in the milk of lactating rats (see Data). Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with OLUMIANT and for 4 days after the last dose (approximately 5 to 6 elimination half-lives).</p><p>Data</p><p>A single oral dose of 25mg/kg radiolabeled baricitinib was administered to lactating female Sprague-Dawley rats on post-partum day 13. Drug exposure was approximately 45-fold greater in milk than in plasma based on AUC0-t values.</p><h2>8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential</h2><p>Contraception</p><p>Based on animal studies, OLUMIANT may cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</p><p>Of the 1200 patients in the alopecia areata clinical trials, a total of 29 patients were 65 years of age or older. The number of patients aged 65 years and older was not sufficient to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients.</p><p>OLUMIANT is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because geriatric patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].</p><h2>8.6 Hepatic Impairment</h2><p>No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment.</p><p>The use of OLUMIANT has not been studied in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or alopecia areata and severe hepatic impairment and is therefore not recommended. OLUMIANT has not been studied in patients with COVID-19 and severe hepatic impairment. OLUMIANT should only be used in patients with COVID-19 and severe hepatic impairment if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</p><h2>8.7 Renal Impairment</h2><p>Renal function was found to significantly affect baricitinib exposure.</p><p>Rheumatoid Arthritis and Alopecia Areata- The recommended dosage of OLUMIANT in patients with moderate renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) between 30 and &lt;60mL/min/1.73m2) should be reduced by half the recommended dose. OLUMIANT is not recommended for use in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or alopecia areata and severe renal impairment (estimated GFR of less than 30mL/min/1.73m2) [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</p><p>COVID-19- The recommended dosage of OLUMIANT in patients with moderate renal impairment (estimated GFR between 30 and &lt;60mL/min/1.732) or severe renal impairment (estimated GFR between 15 and &lt;30mL/min/1.73 m2) is 2mg once daily and 1 mg once daily, respectively. OLUMIANT is not recommended for use in patients who are on dialysis, have end-stage renal disease (ESRD), or with estimated GFR of &lt;15 mL/min/1.73 m2[see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].</p>",

No evidence of tumorigenicity was observed in male or female rats that received baricitinib for 91 to 94 weeks at oral doses up to 8 or 25mg/kg/day, respectively (approximately 7 and 30 times the MRHD on an AUC basis). No evidence of tumorigenicity was observed in Tg.rasH2 mice that received baricitinib for 26 weeks at oral doses up to 300 and 150mg/kg/day in male and female mice, respectively.</p><p>Baricitinib tested negative in the following genotoxicity assays: the in vitro bacterial mutagenicity assay (Ames assay), in vitro chromosome aberration assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes, and in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay.</p><p>Fertility (achievement of pregnancy) was reduced in male and female rats that received baricitinib at oral doses of 50 and 100mg/kg/day respectively (approximately 62 and 93 times the MRHD in males and females, respectively, on an AUC basis) based upon findings that 7 of 19 (36.8%) drug-treated females with evidence of mating were not gravid compared to 1 of 19 (5.3%) control females. It could not be determined from the study design if these findings were attributable to toxicities in one sex or both. Fertility was unaffected in male and female rats at oral doses of 15mg/kg and 25mg/kg, respectively (approximately 13 and 26 times the MRHD on an AUC basis). However, maintenance of pregnancy was adversely affected at these doses based upon findings of increased post-implantation losses (early resorptions) and decreased numbers of mean viable embryos per litter. The number of viable embryos was unaffected in female rats that received baricitinib at an oral dose of 5mg/kg/day and were mated to males that received the same dose (approximately 6 times the MRHD on an AUC basis). Reproductive performance was unaffected in male and female rats that received baricitinib at oral doses up to 50 and 100mg/kg/day respectively (approximately 62 and 93 times the MRHD in males and females, respectively, on an AUC basis).</p>",
      "mechanismOfAction": "<h2>12.1 Mechanism of Action</h2><p>Baricitinib is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. JAKs are intracellular enzymes which transmit signals arising from cytokine or growth factor-receptor interactions on the cellular membrane to influence cellular processes of hematopoiesis and immune cell function. Within the signaling pathway, JAKs phosphorylate and activate Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs) which modulate intracellular activity including gene expression. Baricitinib modulates the signaling pathway at the point of JAKs, preventing the phosphorylation and activation of STATs.</p><p>JAK enzymes transmit cytokine signaling through their pairing (e.g., JAK1/JAK2, JAK1/JAK3, JAK1/TYK2, JAK2/JAK2, JAK2/TYK2). In cell-free isolated enzyme assays, baricitinib had greater inhibitory potency at JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 relative to JAK3. In human leukocytes, baricitinib inhibited cytokine induced STAT phosphorylation mediated by JAK1/JAK2, JAK1/JAK3, JAK1/TYK2, or JAK2/TYK2 with comparable potencies. However, the relevance of inhibition of specific JAK enzymes to therapeutic effectiveness is not currently known.</p>",
