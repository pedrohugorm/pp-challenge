2.3 Important Administration Instructions



EMGALITY is for subcutaneous use only.



EMGALITY is intended for patient self-administration. Prior to use, provide proper training to patients and/or caregivers on how to prepare and administer EMGALITY using the single-dose prefilled pen or single-dose prefilled syringe, including aseptic technique 

[see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (

16.2

) and Instructions for Use]

:





Protect EMGALITY from direct sunlight.



Prior to subcutaneous administration, allow EMGALITY to sit at room temperature for 30\u00a0minutes. Do not warm by using a heat source such as hot water or a microwave.



Do not shake the product.



Inspect EMGALITY visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit 

[see Dosage Forms and Strengths (

Cases of anaphylaxis and angioedema have also been reported in the postmarketing setting. If a serious or severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue administration of EMGALITY and initiate appropriate therapy 

[see Contraindications (

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience



Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.



















Migraine





The safety of EMGALITY has been evaluated in 2586 patients with migraine who received at least one dose of EMGALITY, representing 1487 patient-years of exposure. Of these, 1920 patients were exposed to EMGALITY once monthly for at least 6 months, and 526 patients were exposed for 12 months.



In placebo-controlled clinical studies (Studies 1, 2, and 3), 705 patients received at least one dose of EMGALITY 120\u00a0mg once monthly, and 1451 patients received placebo, during 3 months or 6 months of double-blind treatment 

[see Clinical Studies (

14.1

)]

. Of the EMGALITY-treated patients, approximately 85% were female, 77% were white, and the mean age was 41 years at study entry.



The most common adverse reaction was injection site reactions. In Studies 1, 2, and 3, 1.8% of patients discontinued double-blind treatment because of adverse events. 

Table 1

 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred within up to 6 months of treatment in the migraine studies.

Episodic Cluster Headache





EMGALITY was studied for up to 2 months in a placebo-controlled trial in patients with episodic cluster headache (Study 4) 

[see Clinical Studies (

14.2

)]

. A total of 106 patients were studied (49 on EMGALITY and 57 on placebo). Of the EMGALITY-treated patients, approximately 84% were male, 88% were white, and the mean age was 47 years at study entry. Two EMGALITY-treated patients discontinued double-blind treatment because of adverse events.



Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with episodic cluster headache treated with EMGALITY 300 mg monthly is consistent with the safety profile in migraine patients.





















6.2 Immunogenicity



As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease.



For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to galcanezumab-gnlm in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading.



The immunogenicity of EMGALITY has been evaluated using an in vitro immunoassay for the detection of binding anti-galcanezumab-gnlm antibodies. For patients whose sera tested positive in the screening immunoassay, an in vitro ligand-binding immunoassay was performed to detect neutralizing antibodies.



In controlled studies with EMGALITY up to 6 months (Study 1, Study 2, and Study 3), the incidence of anti-galcanezumab-gnlm antibody development was 4.8% (33/688) in patients receiving EMGALITY once monthly (32 out of 33 of whom had 

in vitro

 neutralizing activity). With 12 months of treatment in an open-label study, up to 12.5% (16/128) of EMGALITY-treated patients developed anti-galcanezumab-gnlm antibodies, most of whom tested positive for neutralizing antibodies.



Although anti-galcanezumab-gnlm antibody development was not found to affect the pharmacokinetics, safety or efficacy of EMGALITY in these patients, the available data are too limited to make definitive conclusions.



















6.3 Postmarketing Experience



The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of EMGALITY. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to EMGALITY exposure.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

















12.1 Mechanism of Action



Galcanezumab-gnlm is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) ligand and blocks its binding to the receptor.



















12.2 Pharmacodynamics



There are no relevant data on the pharmacodynamic effects of galcanezumab-gnlm.



















12.3 Pharmacokinetics



Galcanezumab-gnlm exhibits linear pharmacokinetics and exposure increases proportionally with doses between 1 and 600 mg.



A loading dose of 240\u00a0mg achieved the serum galcanezumab-gnlm steady-state concentration after the first dose. A dose of 300\u00a0mg monthly would achieve steady-state concentration after the fourth dose. The time to maximum concentration is 5 days, and the elimination half-life is 27 days.



There was no difference in pharmacokinetic parameters between healthy volunteers, patients with episodic or chronic migraine, and patients with episodic cluster headache.



















Absorption





Following a subcutaneous dose of galcanezumab-gnlm, the time to maximum concentration was about 5 days.



Injection site location did not significantly influence the absorption of galcanezumab-gnlm.





















Distribution





The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of galcanezumab-gnlm was 7.3\u00a0L (34% Inter Individual Variability [IIV]).





















Metabolism and Elimination





Galcanezumab-gnlm is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG.



The apparent clearance (CL/F) of galcanezumab-gnlm was 0.008\u00a0L/h and the elimination half-life of galcanezumab was approximately 27 days.

















Specific Populations



















Age, Sex, Weight, Race, Ethnicity





The pharmacokinetics of galcanezumab-gnlm were not affected by age, sex, race, subtypes of migraine spectrum (episodic or chronic migraine), or headache diagnosis (migraine vs. episodic cluster headache) based on a population pharmacokinetics analysis. Body weight has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of galcanezumab-gnlm.





















Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment





Renal and hepatic impairment are not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of galcanezumab-gnlm. Population pharmacokinetic analysis of integrated data from the galcanezumab-gnlm clinical studies revealed that creatinine clearance did not affect the pharmacokinetics of galcanezumab-gnlm in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance &lt;30\u00a0mL/min) have not been studied. Based on a population PK analysis, bilirubin concentration did not significantly influence the CL/F of galcanezumab-gnlm.



No dedicated clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of galcanezumab-gnlm.

























Drug Interaction Studies























P450 Enzymes





Galcanezumab-gnlm is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes; therefore, interactions with concomitant medications that are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes are unlikely.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

















14.1 Migraine



The efficacy of EMGALITY was evaluated as a preventive treatment of episodic or chronic migraine in three multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies: two 6-month studies in patients with episodic migraine (Studies 1 and 2) and one 3-month study in patients with chronic migraine (Study 3).



















Episodic Migraine





Study 1 (NCT02614183) and Study 2 (NCT02614196) included adults with a history of episodic migraine (4 to 14 migraine days per month). All patients were randomized in a 1:1:2 ratio to receive once-monthly subcutaneous injections of EMGALITY 120\u00a0mg, EMGALITY 240\u00a0mg, or placebo. All patients in the 120 mg EMGALITY group received an initial 240\u00a0mg loading dose. Patients were allowed to use acute headache treatments, including migraine-specific medications (i.e., triptans, ergotamine derivatives), NSAIDs, and acetaminophen during the study.



The studies excluded patients on any other migraine preventive treatment, patients with medication overuse headache, patients with ECG abnormalities compatible with an acute cardiovascular event and patients with a history of stroke, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism within 6 months of screening.



The primary efficacy endpoint for Studies 1 and 2 was the mean change from baseline in the number of monthly migraine headache days over the 6-month treatment period. Key secondary endpoints included response rates (the mean percentages of patients reaching at least 50%, 75%, and 100% reduction from baseline in the number of monthly migraine headache days over the 6-month treatment period), the mean change from baseline in the number of monthly migraine headache days with use of any acute headache medication during the 6-month treatment period, and the impact of migraine on daily activities, as assessed by the mean change from baseline in the average Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire version 2.1 (MSQ v2.1) Role Function-Restrictive domain score during the last 3 months of treatment (Months 4 to 6). Scores are scaled from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating less impact of migraine on daily activities.



In Study 1, a total of 858 patients (718 females, 140 males) ranging in age from 18 to 65 years, were randomized. A total of 703 patients completed the 6-month double-blind phase. In Study 2, a total of 915 patients (781 female, 134 male) ranging in age from 18 to 65 years, were randomized. A total of 785 patients completed the 6-month double-blind phase. In Study\u00a01 and Study\u00a02, the mean migraine frequency at baseline was approximately 9 migraine days per month, and was similar across treatment groups.



EMGALITY 120\u00a0mg demonstrated statistically significant improvements for efficacy endpoints compared to placebo over the 6-month period, as summarized in 

Table 2

. EMGALITY treatment with the 240\u00a0mg once-monthly dose showed no additional benefit over the EMGALITY 120\u00a0mg once-monthly dose.

Chronic Migraine





Study 3 (NCT02614261) included adults with a history of chronic migraine (\u226515 headache days per month with \u22658\u00a0migraine days per month). All patients were randomized in a 1:1:2 ratio to receive once-monthly subcutaneous injections of EMGALITY 120\u00a0mg, EMGALITY 240\u00a0mg, or placebo over a 3-month treatment period. All patients in the 120\u00a0mg EMGALITY group received an initial 240\u00a0mg loading dose.



Patients were allowed to use acute headache treatments including migraine-specific medications (i.e., triptans, ergotamine derivatives), NSAIDs, and acetaminophen. A subset of patients (15%) was allowed to use one concomitant migraine preventive medication. Patients with medication overuse headache were allowed to enroll.



The study excluded patients with ECG abnormalities compatible with an acute cardiovascular event, and patients with a history of stroke, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism within 6 months of screening.



The primary endpoint was the mean change from baseline in the number of monthly migraine headache days over the 3-month treatment period. The secondary endpoints were response rates (the mean percentages of patients reaching at least 50%, 75% and 100% reduction from baseline in the number of monthly migraine headache days over the 3-month treatment period), the mean change from baseline in the number of monthly migraine headache days with use of any acute headache medication during the 3-month treatment period, and the impact of migraine on daily activities as assessed by the mean change from baseline in the MSQ v2.1 Role Function-Restrictive domain score at Month 3. Scores are scaled from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating less impact of migraine on daily activities.



In Study 3, a total of 1113 patients (946 female, 167 male) ranging in age from 18 to 65 years, were randomized. A total of 1037 patients completed the 3-month double-blind phase. The mean number of monthly migraine headache days at baseline was approximately 19.



EMGALITY 120\u00a0mg demonstrated statistically significant improvement for the mean change from baseline in the number of monthly migraine headache days over the 3-month treatment period, and in the mean percentage of patients reaching at least 50% reduction from baseline in the number of monthly migraine headache days over the 3-month treatment period, as summarized in 

Table 3

. EMGALITY treatment with the 240\u00a0mg once-monthly dose showed no additional benefit over the EMGALITY 120\u00a0mg once-monthly dose.

Study 3 utilized a sequential testing procedure to control the Type-I error rate for the multiple secondary endpoints. Once a secondary endpoint failed to reach the required level for statistical significance, formal hypothesis testing was terminated for subsequent endpoints, and p-values were considered nominal only. In Study 3, EMGALITY 120\u00a0mg was not significantly better than placebo for the proportion of patients with \u226575% or 100% reduction in migraine headache days. Patients treated with EMGALITY 120\u00a0mg showed a nominally greater reduction in the number of monthly migraine headache days that acute medication was taken (-4.7 for EMGALITY 120 mg vs. -2.2 for placebo; nominal p-value &lt;0.001), and the mean change from baseline in the MSQ Role Function-Restrictive Domain score at Month 3 was nominally greater in patients treated with EMGALITY 120\u00a0mg than in patients on placebo (21.8 for EMGALITY 120\u00a0mg vs. 16.8 for placebo; nominal p-value\u00a0&lt;0.001).

14.2 Episodic Cluster Headache



The efficacy of EMGALITY was evaluated for the treatment of episodic cluster headache in a randomized, 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 4).



Study 4 (NCT02397473) included adults who met the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3

rd

 edition (beta version) diagnostic criteria for episodic cluster headache and had a maximum of 8 attacks per day, a minimum of one attack every other day, and at least 4\u00a0attacks during the prospective 7-day baseline period. All patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive once-monthly subcutaneous injections of EMGALITY 300\u00a0mg or placebo. Patients were allowed to use certain specified acute/abortive cluster headache treatments, including triptans, oxygen, acetaminophen, and NSAIDs during the study.



The study excluded patients on other treatments intended to reduce the frequency of cluster headache attacks; patients with medication overuse headache; patients with ECG abnormalities compatible with an acute cardiovascular event or conduction delay; and patients with a history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism within 6 months of screening. In addition, patients with any history of stroke, intracranial or carotid aneurysm, intracranial hemorrhage, or vasospastic angina; clinical evidence of peripheral vascular disease; or diagnosis of Raynaud\u2019s disease were excluded.



The primary efficacy endpoint for Study 4 was the mean change from baseline in weekly cluster headache attack frequency across Weeks 1 to 3. A secondary endpoint was the percentage of patients who achieved a response (defined as a reduction from baseline of 50% or greater in the weekly cluster headache attack frequency) at Week 3.



In Study 4, a total of 106 patients (88 males, 18 females) ranging in age from 19 to 65 years were randomized and treated. A total of 90 patients completed the 8-week double-blind phase. In the prospective baseline phase, the mean number of weekly cluster headache attacks was 17.5, and was similar across treatment groups.



EMGALITY 300\u00a0mg demonstrated statistically significant improvements for efficacy endpoints compared to placebo, as summarized in

Pregnancy Exposure Registry





There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to EMGALITY during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register pregnant patients, or pregnant women may enroll themselves in the registry by calling 1-833-464-4724 or by contacting the company at www.migrainepregnancyregistry.com.





Risk Summary





There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of EMGALITY in pregnant women. Administration of galcanezumab-gnlm to rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis or to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation at plasma exposures greater than that expected clinically did not result in adverse effects on development 

(see Animal Data)

.



In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% - 4% and 15% - 20%, respectively. The estimated rate of major birth defects (2.2% - 2.9%) and miscarriage (17%) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine.





















Clinical Considerations





















Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk





Published data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy.

Parts of the EMGALITY Prefilled Syringe















































Before You Get Started











Take the Prefilled Syringes from the refrigerator





Take 3 EMGALITY prefilled syringes from the refrigerator.













Check your prescription.





EMGALITY comes as a single-dose prefilled syringe.



You will need 3 prefilled syringes for each dose.

















Leave the needle caps on until you are ready to inject.













Leave the prefilled syringes at room temperature for 30 minutes before injecting.













Do not

 microwave the prefilled syringes, run hot water over them, or leave them in direct sunlight.













Do not

 shake.









Gather Supplies







For each injection you will need: 







1 alcohol wipe



1 cotton ball or piece of gauze



1 sharps disposal container. See \u201c

After You Inject Your Medicine

.\u201d













Inspect the Prefilled Syringe and the medicine





Make sure you have the right medicine. The medicine inside should be clear. Its color may be colorless to slightly yellow to slightly brown.













Do not

 use the prefilled syringe, and throw away (dispose of) as directed by your healthcare provider or pharmacist if:





it looks damaged



the medicine is cloudy, is discolored, or has small particles



the Expiration Date (Exp.)  printed on the label has passed



the medicine is frozen













Expiration Date



















Prepare for injection





Wash your hands with soap and water before you inject your EMGALITY. Make sure a sharps disposal container is close by.



























Choose your injection site









Your healthcare provider can help you choose the injection site that is best for you.



























You

 may inject the medicine into your stomach area (abdomen). 

Do not

 inject within 2 inches of the belly button (navel).















You may inject the medicine into the front of your thighs. This area should be at least 2 inches above the knee and 2 inches below the groin.

















Another person

 may give you the injection in the back of your upper arm or buttocks.

















Do not

 inject in the exact same spot. For example, if your first injection was in your abdomen, your next injection could be in another area of your abdomen.















Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard.

















Clean your injection site with an alcohol wipe. Let the injection site dry before you inject.

If you do not have an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is:



















\u2013



made of a heavy-duty plastic,



















\u2013



can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out,



















\u2013



upright and stable during use,

leak-resistant, and



















\u2013



properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container.















When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away needles and syringes. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state you live in, go to the FDA's website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal.

















Do not

 recycle your used sharps disposal container.













For each of the 3 injections, repeat all instructions with a new prefilled syringe.























Commonly Asked Questions



















Q.







What if I see air bubbles in my EMGALITY prefilled syringe?











A.





It is normal to have air bubbles in the prefilled syringe. EMGALITY is injected under your skin (subcutaneous injection), so these air bubbles will not harm you.





















Q.







What if there is a drop of liquid on the tip of the needle when I remove the needle cap?











A.





It is okay to see a drop of liquid on the tip of the needle.





















Q.







What if I cannot push in the plunger?











A.





If the plunger is stuck or damaged:

















Do not

 continue to use the syringe



















Remove the needle from your skin



















Dispose of the syringe and get a new one

























Q.







What if there is a drop of liquid or blood on my skin after my injection?











A.





This is normal. Press a cotton ball or gauze over the injection site. 

Do not

 rub the injection site.





















Q.







How can I tell if my injection is complete?











A.





When your injection is complete:















The coral plunger rod should show through the body of the syringe.



















The gray syringe plunger should be pushed all the way to the needle end of the syringe.
